你可以斥责梅赛德斯。
她不再听我说话了。
You can reprimand Mercédès.
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

142
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,580
也许她会是
婚礼迟到了。
Maybe she'll be
late for the wedding.

143
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
- 啊，终于！

抱歉我的延误，

贺拉斯·德·巴利奥斯

147
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,450
做了他想做的事。
我差点撞到他了。

I almost hit him.

148
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,080
但无论如何，梅赛德斯。
But anyway, Mercédès.

149
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,660
这位先生是谁？
Who is this gentleman?

150
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,120
这是一匹马。他来了
来自一个非常好的家庭。
It's a horse. He comes
from a very good family.

151
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,870

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
梅赛德斯。

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,290
你准备好了吗
派对？埃德蒙有大消息。
Are you ready for the
party? Edmond has big news.

155
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,750

156
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,410
是的，我将成为队长。
Yes, I will be captain.

157
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,870
法老的
队长。这是官方的。
Pharaoh's
Captain. It's official.

158
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,620
- 那么真相呢？
- 唔。
- And truth?
- Hmm.

159
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,700
- 好工作。
- 为了队长！

160
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,330

-Oh! For your health!

161
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,540

- I'm happy for you.
- Me too. I am happy

162
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,580
- 为我。 健康。
- 你打算买一套新制服吗？
- for me. Health.
- Are you going to buy a new uniform?

163
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
还有新的工资。
And a new salary.

164
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,040
他就能享受生活，
He will be able to enjoy life,

165
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,750
利用
的好天气。
to take advantage
of the good weather.

166
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,000
我们会向您解释。
We will explain it to you.

167
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,700
我将能够得到
结婚了，最重要的是。
I will be able to get
married, above all.

168
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,950
什么？
What?

169
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,830
你将成为我的见证人。
You will be my witness.

170
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,700
- 别指望它！
- 嗯，是的！
- Don't count on it!
- Well, yes!

171
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,120
浪费的见证！
梅塞德斯，说句话。
The witness of a waste!
Mercédès, say something.

172
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,410
- 我试过了，但他疯狂地爱着。
- 哦，完全疯了。
- I tried, but he's madly in love.
- Oh, completely crazy.

173
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,500
她知道这一点吗？
最后，她同意吗？
And does she know this?
Finally, does she agree?

174
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,330
是的。从她告诉我的情况来看，
Yes. From what she told me,

175
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,790
- 是的，是的。
- 我知道。
- Yes yes.
- I know.

176
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,290
是朱丽叶。
It's Juliet.

177
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,370
- WHO？
- 有着顽皮脸的女裁缝。
- Who?
- The seamstress with the naughty face.

178
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,660
不！不，这不是朱丽叶。
No! No, it's not Juliette.

179
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,410
不，这是一个真正的女人，
No, it's a real woman,

180
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
很漂亮。
very beautiful.

181
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,950
不仅仅是漂亮。
Not just pretty.

182
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
唔。
Hmm.

183
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,200
- 神秘而迷人。
- 是的！ 不不，
- Mysterious and captivating.
- Yes! No no,

184
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,160
- 是的，是的。
- 但是谁？
- Yes yes.
- But who is it?

185
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,370
她是你的表弟。
She is your cousin.

186
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,370
梅塞德斯·埃雷拉·德·马尔塞夫。
Mercédès Herrera de Morcerf.

187
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
你？
You?

188
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,370
- 是的。
- 我们结婚吧。
- Yes.
- Let's get married.

189
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,580
但她完全疯了。
But she's completely crazy.

190
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,580
还有你妈妈
永远不会想要。
And your mother
will never want to.

191
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
- 你认为妈妈
可以拒绝我什么吗？
- Do you think mom
can refuse me anything?

192
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,870
然后你就会说服她。她
一直是你最喜欢的侄女。
Then you will convince her. She
was always your favorite niece.

193
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,790
阿们！
AMEN!

194
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
我把它带到这里，
I carry it here,

195
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,580
由维尔福先生签署，
signed by Mr. de Villefort,

196
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,950
国王的律师，

197
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,790
逮捕令
这个人名叫爱德蒙·唐太斯。
an arrest warrant for the
man named Edmond Dantès.

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,790
- 跟着我们。
- Follow us.

199
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,000
这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

200
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,750
- 不，留下它。
- 必须有一个解释。
- No, leave it.

201
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,620
- 来。

202
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,910
- 等待。

- Wait.
- Fernand, do something!

203
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,450
- 这是什么？我的儿子
没有做任何事情。
- What is it? My son
didn't do anything.

204
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,830
这一定是一个误会。
This must be a misunderstanding.

205
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,040
他们要去哪里
他？我会陪你。
Where are they taking
him? I will accompany you.

206
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,750
- 我们必须单独对付他，先生。
- 中尉。
- We must take him alone, sir.
- Lieutenant.

207
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,540
费尔南·德·马尔塞夫中尉。
Lieutenant Fernand de Morcerf.

208
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,120
告诉你的朋友
让我们过去。
Tell your friends
to let us pass.

209
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,790
这是真正的订单。

210
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,330
我会处理的。
I'll take care of it.

211
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,330
- 现在请关注我们。

212
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,330
我会回来的，我的爱人。

213
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,660
埃德蒙·唐泰斯，律师先生。
Edmond Dantès, Mr. Attorney.

214
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,950
离开我们。
Leave us.

215
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,330
我一直很欣赏
像你这样的水手，唐太斯先生。
I've always admired
sailors like you, Mr. Dantès.

216
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,620
我只是害怕大海。
I'm just afraid of the sea.

217
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,450
确实如此，这无尽的深渊。
It's true, this endless abyss.

218
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,500
这些黑水。
These black waters.

219
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
怪物似乎总是做好准备
出来吞噬你。
A monster always seems ready
to come out and devour you.

220
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,660
- 我被指控什么？为什么
我会在婚礼上被捕吗？
- What am I being accused of? Why
am I being arrested at my wedding?

221
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,080
你有吗
敌人，唐泰斯大人？
Do you have any
enemies, Lord Dantes?

222
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,160
一个……敌人？
A... an enemy?

223
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,040
或者嫉妒。
Or jealous.

224
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,450
刚刚被任命为​​队长，你是
会嫁给一个美丽的伴侣...
Just been named captain, You're
going to marry a beautiful match...

225
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,790
它可能使
人们嫉妒。
It might have made
people jealous.

226
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,410
我不知道，不。
I don't know, no.

227
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,620
我有不同意见
最近和船员一起，
I had a disagreement
recently with a crew member,

228
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,500
但他能指责我什么呢？
But what could he accuse me of?

229
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,160
我不知道。
I don't know.

230
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,870
成为一个拿破仑
例如，代理。
To be a Napoleonic
agent, for example.

231
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,330
饶恕？
Forgiveness?

232
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,410
但是……这没有意义。
But... that doesn't make sense.

233
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,120
- 我们发现了这个
圣经在你的小屋里。
- We found this
Bible in your cabin.

234
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,000
这是你的圣经吗？
Is this your Bible?

235
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
上面写着你的名字。
It has your name written on it.

236
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,870
是的，最后，是这样的
仍然不构成犯罪。
Yes, finally, it is
still not a crime.

237
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,450
和真相。
And truth.

238
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,830
但我们也发现了一个
里面的任务指令
But we also found a
mission order inside

239
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,080
拿破仑亲笔签名。
signed in Napoleon's own hand.

240
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,410
这是犯罪行为。
And that is a crime.

241
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,950
等待。
Wait.

242
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,750
不，这是第一次
我看过这封信。
No, this is the first time
I have seen this letter.

243
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,540
如果没有敌人，谁会
可以把它放在那里吗？
If there is no enemy, who
could have put it there?

244
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,040
在科索角海岸附近，我
救了一名溺水的年轻女孩。
Off the coast of Cape Corso, I
saved a young girl from drowning.

245
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,830
她在你的小屋里向你道谢了吗？
Did she thank you in your cabin?

246
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,830
不。
No.

247
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
腾格拉尔锁住了她
那里。她离开了马赛。
Danglars locked her
there. She left in Marseilles.

248
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,450
你可以检查一下。
You can check.

249
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,660
询问工头
加斯帕·卡德鲁斯。
Ask the foreman
Gaspar Caderousse.

250
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,080
- 卡德鲁斯？
- 是的。
- Caderousse?
- Yes.

251
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,120
你对她了解多少？
What do you know about her?

252
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
没有什么。
Nothing.

253
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,250
唐泰斯先生。
Mr Dantes.

254
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,200
我采访了几十个
阴谋者的
I interviewed dozens
of conspirators

255
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,330
我不认为
这是其中之一。
and I don't think
it's one of them.

256
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,830
我想帮助一个
马尔塞夫家族的朋友，
I would like to help a
friend of the Morcerfs,

257
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,290
但我需要你帮助我。
but I need you to help me.

258
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,910
我发誓我不知道
关于她的任何事情。
I swear I don't know
anything about her.

259
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,540
她告诉我她的名字叫安吉拉。
She told me her name was Angèle.

260
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,660
就这样。
That's all.

261
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,540
你...
You...

262
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,700
你有暴露这个年轻吗
女人的名字给任何人吗？
Did you reveal this young
woman's name to anyone?

263
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
不。
No.

264
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,580
连这个卡德鲁斯也不行吗？
Not even for this Caderousse?

265
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
不。
No.

266
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,620
不为任何人。荣誉的话。
For no one. word of honor.

267
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,160
你看，唐太斯先生，
我相信你。
You see, Mr. Dantès,
I believe in you.

268
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,250
然而我还是会被逼
为了让它保持更长的时间，
However, I will be forced
to keep it a little longer,

269
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,700
提问时间
其余的船员。
time to question
the rest of the crew.

270
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,950
如果他们证实了你的证词
对此我毫不怀疑，
If they confirm your testimony,
of which I have no doubt,

271
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,290
我会把你还给你的新娘
你会有很多时间来恨我。
I will return you to your bride, that
you will have a lot of time to hate me.

272
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,580
指望她。
Count on her.

273
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,870
费尔南德将带来
它返回给你。
Fernand will bring
it back to you.

274
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,080
我受不了
再说了，我走了。
I can't take it
anymore, I'm going.

275
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,750
我无能为力了。
There's nothing more I can do.

276
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,160
这对你有好处
如果他们不释放他。
It would be good for you
if they didn't release him.

277
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,200
怎么能说出如此恐怖的话呢？
How can you say such horrors?

278
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,500
热拉尔，无论他们说什么
关于唐太斯，我保证。
Gérard, whatever they told
you about Dantès, I guarantee it.

279
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,750
先生们，请稍等一下。
Leave us a moment, gentlemen.

280
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,660
费尔南德 我真是这样
对你的朋友感到抱歉。
Fernand, I'm so
sorry about your friend.

281
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,750
我知道你们的关系。
I know your connections.

282
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,830
但他并不知道一切。
But he doesn't know everything.

283
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,000
我们找到了任务指令
从皇帝身上传到他身上。
We found a mission order
from the Emperor on him.

284
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,790
而他的同伴们则说
他是他们的支持者之一。
And his companions say
he is one of their supporters.

285
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,330
我想你明白
这些指控的严重性。
I think you understand the
seriousness of these accusations.

286
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,370
此前他曾被捕
与梅塞德斯结婚
He was arrested before
marrying Mercédès

287
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,790
并且无法挽回的
没有承诺，
and that the irreparable
is not committed,

288
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,830
但如果你愿意担保
but if you're willing to vouch,

289
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,120
如果你认为这些
两个男人都在说谎……
If you think these
two men are lying...

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,910
如果你愿意的话
冒这个风险，
If you are willing
to take that risk,

291
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,870
那我就放你自由。
then I will set you free.

292
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,450
你只有一个字要说。
You only have one word to say.

293
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,370
不。
No.

294
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
不？
No?

295
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,580
他不值得...
He doesn't deserve it...

296
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,080
他不值得什么？
What doesn't he deserve?

297
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,450
愿我们一家人
名字会被玷污。
May our family
name be tarnished.

298
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,200
如果唐太斯背叛了我们
If Dantes betrayed us,

299
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,540
愿他受苦吗
叛徒的命运。
may he suffer
the fate of traitors.

300
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,370
我可以确定...
I can be sure...

301
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,660
愿没有诉讼玷污
马尔塞夫家族的声誉。
May no lawsuit tarnish the
reputation of the Morcerfs.

302
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,040
我需要你的证词。
I'll need your testimony.

303
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,000
你明白吗
怎么了？
Do you understand
what is happening?

304
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,450
所以闭嘴。
So shut up.

305
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,750
- 唐太斯先生？
- 你能和检察官谈话吗？
- Mr. Dantès?
- Were you able to speak to the prosecutor?

306
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,540
- 是的，先生。
- Yes sir.

307
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,120
这是我不会忘记的一天。
This is a day I will not forget.

308
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,250
你不带我回家吗？
Won't you take me home?

309
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,040
不，事实上。
No, in fact.

310
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,450
我们走吧。
Let's go.

311
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,080
怎么了？
怎么了？
What is happening?
What is happening?

312
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,080
让我走吧。
Let me go.

313
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,870
打电话给检察官我
与检察官交谈！
Call the Prosecutor I
spoke to the Prosecutor!

314
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,120
和他谈谈。跟他说话！
Talk to him. Talk to him!

315
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,830
我是无辜的！我没有
做任何事！让我走吧。
I'm innocent! I didn't
do anything! Let me go.

316
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,370
嘘，嘘，嘘。
Shh, shh, shh.

317
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,290
你就会有罪，你
会被绞死的。我们带你，
You would have been guilty, you
would have been hanged. We take you,

318
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,250
因为他知道事情
我们不想听。
because he knows things
we don't want to hear.

319
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,700
我们走吧。
Let's go.

320
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,750
停止。
Stop.

321
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,910
停止！
Stop!

322
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,540
让我走吧！
Let me go!

323
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,830
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

324
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,750
我什么也做不了。
I couldn't do anything.

325
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
梅赛德斯。
Mercédès.

326
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,370
离开我吧。
Leave me.

327
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,330
这不会有任何好处。
It wouldn't do any good.

328
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,830
-梅赛德斯...
- 停下来。
-Mercédès...
- To stop.

329
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,120
请。
Please.

330
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,370
怎么了，维多利亚？
What's wrong, Victoria?

331
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,830
- 见到我你不高兴吗？
- 你姐姐在这里。
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Your sister is here.

332
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,540
维尔福小姐。
Miss de Villefort.

333
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,620
《秘密》非常适合你。
Clandestine suits you perfectly.

334
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,370
抱歉我无法返回
的赞美。
Sorry I can't return
the compliment.

335
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,580
白兰地？对不起，
我的海水没了
Brandy? Sorry,
I'm out of sea water.

336
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,120
是的，这是我的工作
知道一切。
Yes, it's my job to
know everything.

337
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,750
所以你知道
唐太斯是无辜的。
So you know that
Dantes is innocent.

338
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,620
无辜...是的。
Innocent... Yes.

339
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,750
谁是真正无辜的？
Who is really innocent?

340
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,040
他什么也没做。
你为什么阻止他？
He didn't do anything.
Why did you stop him?

341
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,660
但为了救你的命。
But to save your life.

342
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,040
我的生命还是你的名声？
My life or your reputation?

343
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,450
- 我们都从事政治。
- We are both in politics.

344
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,330
在政治上，我们做
不排除一个男人，
In politics, we do
not exclude a man,

345
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,080
我们已经消除了一个障碍。
we have removed an obstacle.

346
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,200
我就知道他练过
他的职业残酷，
I knew that he practiced
his profession with cruelty,

347
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,950
但我期待你
诚实地去做。
but I expected you
to do it honestly.

348
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,290
你为什么不
代替他举报？
Why don't you
report it in his place?

349
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,910
但我会的，热拉尔。
But I will, Gérard.

350
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,450
如果你拒绝
救救他，我会的。
If you refuse to
save him, I will.

351
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,700
但你愿意
人们忽视我的存在
But would you rather
people ignore my existence,

352
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,620
维多利亚的，
Victoria's,

353
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,290
你的爱人，
Your lover,

354
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,200
和你未来的孩子。
and your future child.

355
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,830
这正是我的想法。
That's exactly what I thought.

356
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,080
活？
Alive?

357
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,750
活。
Alive.

358
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,660
活？
Alive?

359
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
活！
Alive!

360
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,290
活？
Alive?

361
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
活。
Alive.

362
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,870
走远点...
离开海岸...
Go far away...
Leave the coast...

363
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,200
谁知道
方式...谁知道具体...
And who knows the
way... Who knows exactly...

364
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,250
有人在吗？
有人在吗？
Is anyone there?
Is anyone there?

365
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,250
有人。
有人。
There is someone.
There is someone.

366
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
有人在吗？
Is anyone there?

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,620
有人。
有人。
There is someone.
There is someone.

368
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,330
有人。
There is someone.

369
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,620
- 你是谁？
- Who are you?

370
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,250
呃，我……唐泰斯，爱德蒙·唐泰斯。
Uh, I... Dantès, Edmond Dantès.

371
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,750
- 你今年多大？
- How old are you?

372
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,700
- 你的声音听起来像个年轻人。
- 我有...
- Your voice sounds like a young man.
- I have...

373
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,500
我不知道了。
I don't know anymore.

374
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,200
那年我22岁...
当他们把我锁起来的时候。
I was 22 years old...
when they locked me up.

375
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,540
1815 年 5 月 16 日。
May 16, 1815.

376
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,540
那是四年前的事了。
It was four years ago.

377
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,950
他今年 26 岁。
He is 26 years old.

378
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,620
四年？
Four years?

379
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
和...
AND...

380
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,250
而你，你是谁？
And you, who are you?

381
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,540
一个囚犯。
A prisoner.

382
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,330
就像你一样。
Like you.

383
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,620
已经多久了？
How long has it been?

384
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,700
嘘！
Shh!

385
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,790
什么？
What?

386
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,370
- 他们来了。
- 等待。
- They're coming.
- Wait.

387
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,410
别离开我。
Don't leave me.

388
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,750
你是谁？在
至少告诉我你的名字。
Who are you? At
least tell me your name.

389
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,120
你的名字！
Your name!

390
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,330
诈骗
Scams

391
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,080
34！活？
34! Alive?

392
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,160
活。
Alive.

393
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,200
我在等你。
I was waiting for you.

394
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,700
你真的认为
你能离开这里吗？
Do you really think
you can get out of here?

395
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,750
六年里我挖了30m。
I dug 30 m in six years.

396
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,040
绕过您的手机
并到达外面，
To bypass your cell
and reach the outside,

397
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,370
你必须
挖两倍的时间。
you will have to
dig twice as long.

398
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,250
12年？
12 years?

399
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,410
现在可能会少一点
我们将有两个人。
Maybe a little less, now
that there will be two of us.

400
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,870
为了什么？你
还有其他计划吗？
For what? Do you
have other plans?

401
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,410
不。

我要去寻找梅赛德斯。

忙着报仇，

谁背叛了他们，

这是红衣主教斯帕达。

在他生命的最后时刻，
基督山岛上的避难所，
At the end of his life, taking
refuge on the island of Monte Cristo,

458
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,540

训练最后一名骑士。

心中充满仇恨？

远离！
Stay away!

478
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,000
方丈？
Abbot?

479
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,250
方丈？方丈？
Abbot? Abbot?

别伤心。

你曾是唯一
是我生命中的安慰。

consolation in my life.

488

有点晚了，但是
他把它给了我。

I'll give you something to eat.
But then it disappears, right?

545
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,000
还有梅塞……梅塞德斯？
And Mercé... Mercédès?

546
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,580
费尔南·德·马尔塞夫呢？
And Fernand de Morcerf?

547
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,540
- 一定是7或8
距离他们上次来已经有很多年了。
- It must have been 7 or 8
years since they last came.

548
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,870
他们曾在巴黎生活过
自从他们的儿子出生以来。
They have lived in Paris
since the birth of their son.

549
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,080
已经很晚了。
It's very late.

550
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,910
避开利古里亚海
Avoid the Ligurian Sea

551
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,000
以及他们不间断的巡逻。
and their incessant patrols.

552
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,450
前往撒丁岛。
Head to Sardinia.

553
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,580
你可以停在圣诞老人那里
特蕾莎·迪·加卢拉。
You can stop in Santa
Teresa di Gallura.

554
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,830
蒙特岛
基督位于
The island of Monte
Christ is located

555
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,410
托斯卡纳群岛以西。
west of the Tuscan Archipelago.

556
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,450
它将降落在遥远的南方。
It will land in the far south.

557
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,330
我知道你会印象深刻
以其朴素之美。
I know you will be impressed
by its austere beauty.

558
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,750
我羡慕他发现
这是第一次。
I envy him discovering
this for the first time.

559
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,200
然后。
Then.

560
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,830
它就在那里。
It's there.

561
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,290
的金库
显赫的斯帕达家族。
The vault of the
illustrious Spada family.

562
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,160
剩下的，埃德蒙，
The rest, Edmond,

563
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,700
这是你的故事。
It's your story.

564
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,540
一个拥有世界的男人
That of a man who has the world

565
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,160
在你的手掌中。
in the palm of your hand.

566
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,200
马赛 一年后
Marseille One year later

567
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:43,080
- 请继续。
- 停止。
- Please go ahead.
- Stop.

568
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,160
- 我明天付钱给你。
- 不不。 加斯帕，出去。
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
- No no. Gaspar, get out.

569
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,660
卡德鲁斯先生
是我的一个朋友。
Mr. Caderousse
is a friend of mine.

570
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,450
埃德蒙临终前
唐太斯要我分享
On his deathbed, Edmond
Dantes asked me to share

571
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,120
在那些人之中
对他来说很重要。
among those who
were important to him.

572
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,620
他以为他已经
受到腾格拉尔某位人士的谴责。
He thought he had been
denounced by a certain Danglars.

573
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,160
但他坚信两个
人们仍然忠于他。
But he was convinced that two
men had remained loyal to him.

574
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,580
他告诉我：
He told me:

575
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,370
“有一个叫
加斯帕德·卡德鲁斯,
“One is called
Gaspard Caderousse,

576
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,290
“第二个，
费尔南·德·马尔塞夫。”
"and the second,
Fernand de Morcerf."

577
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,540
保留你的钻石。
Keep your diamond.

578
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,910
我们谁都不配得到任何东西。
None of us deserve anything.

579
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,120
等等，我的儿子。
Wait, my son.

580
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,040
如果我向你透露我所知道的事情
我们会知道它来自我。
If I reveal to you what I know,
we will know it came from me.

581
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,540
还有这些人
有钱有势。
And these people
are rich and powerful.

582
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,790
没什么好害怕的
There's nothing to fear,

583
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,040
我受以下约束
坦白的秘密。
I am bound by the
secrecy of confession.

584
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,580
坐下。
Sit down.

585
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,950
唐太斯对腾格拉尔的看法是正确的。
他就是举报他的人。
Dantes was right about Danglars.
He was the one who reported him.

586
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:06,540
但是费尔南·德·马尔塞夫呢？
他是你的朋友。
But Fernand de Morcerf?
He was your friend.

587
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,120
你能和
你垂涎谁的妻子？
Can you be friends with the
one whose wife you covet?

588
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,250
出于对梅赛德斯的热爱，
For the love of Mercédès,

589
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,410
他牺牲了爱德蒙。
he sacrificed Edmond.

590
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,950
他会活下去。但对于
所有人，他都会死。
He will live. But for
everyone, he will be dead.

591
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,000
唔。
Hmm.

592
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,410
唯一一个愿意
值得唐太斯喜爱的是莫雷尔。
The only one who would
deserve Dantès' affection is Morrel.

593
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,370
船主？
The ship owner?

594
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,410
他为他而战
被释放。
He fought for him
to be released.

595
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,290
他也是，普罗维登斯
很少感谢他。
And he too, Providence
thanked him very little.

596
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,080
唐太斯被捕后，
After Dantes' arrest,

597
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,830
不得不接受腾格拉尔
回来担任队长。
had to accept Danglars
back as captain.

598
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,250
但腾格拉尔也背叛了他。
But Danglars also betrayed him.

599
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,200
摧毁了他一半的舰队
Destroyed half of his fleet,

600
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,450
据称是被海盗偷走的。
allegedly stolen by pirates.

601
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,870
莫雷尔毁了
出售公司。
Ruined, Morrel had
to sell the company.

602
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,370
猜猜是谁
花点微薄的钱买的？
And guess who
bought it for a pittance?

603
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,830
腾格拉尔。
Danglars.

604
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,040
两个月后，
船又出现了。
Two months later,
the boats reappeared.

605
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,370
但检察官
维尔福没有屈服。
But the Prosecutor
Villefort did not give in.

606
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,500
必须要说的是
他们分享了一个秘密。
It must be said that
they shared a secret.

607
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,700
小维多利亚，
维尔福的情人，
Little Victoria,
Villefort's lover,

608
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,450
成为腾格拉尔夫人。
became Madame Danglars.

609
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,500
今天她是男爵夫人。
She is a baroness today.

610
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,040
莫雷尔死于贫困。
Morrel died in poverty.

611
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,450
而你呢，在
卡德鲁斯先生，这一切？
And what about you, in
all this, Mr. Caderousse?

612
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,290
你？
You?

613
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,250
我能做什么
What could I do

614
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,870
面对队长，
伯爵和检察官？
facing a captain, a
count and a procurator?

615
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:51,580
如果我再勇敢一些，我可能
就会像她一样结束。
If I had been braver, I probably
would have ended up like her.

616
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,540
她？
She?

617
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:55,290
安琪儿.
Angele.

618
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:02,200
她去看她了
哥哥去救唐太斯。
She had gone to see her
brother to save Dantès.

619
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,620
我释放了自己
I freed myself

620
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,870
唐太斯着。起来了
让你摆脱它。
by Dantes. It's up
to you to get rid of it.

621
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,160
看？我也有朋友。
Look? I also have friends.

622
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,500
发生了什么？
What happened?

623
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,700
她被杀了吗？
Was she killed?

624
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,580
她的痛苦就会少一些。
She would have suffered less.

625
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,620
腾格拉尔有
为她制定其他计划。
Danglars had
other plans for her.

626
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,790
他把它卖给了美拉德兄弟，
土伦的篮筐大师。
He sold it to the Maillard brothers,
the basket masters of Toulon.

627
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,830
小的本来就很漂亮
The little one was beautiful,

628
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,750
得到了一个很好的价格。
got a good price for it.

629
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,790
他什么都知道
但什么也没做。
He knew everything
and did nothing.

630
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,080
我很惭愧，父亲。
I'm ashamed, Father.

631
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,160
总有一天我会回来。
One day I will return.

632
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,910
我将为您提供
救赎自己的机会。
And I will offer you the
opportunity to redeem yourself.

633
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:07,040
我不再来祈祷
为你或寻找你，
I no longer come to pray
for you or look for you,

634
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,660
但只是想让你知道：
but just to let you know:

635
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,700
我会做你做不到的事。
I will do what you couldn't do.

636
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,540
从今以后，我就是那个人了
谁奖励谁惩罚。
From now on, I'm the one
who rewards and punishes.

637
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,450
你想要什么吗？
Do you want something?

638
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,410
- 你是谁？
- Who are you?

639
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,580
几年前，
Years ago,

640
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,250
你告诉我：
you told me:

641
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,870
“我不会忘记你的
勇气，但忘了我的名字。”
"I will not forget your
courage, but forget my name."

642
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:58,000
还好我没有忘记
你的名字或你的勇气。
Well, I haven't forgotten
your name or your courage.

643
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,120
唐太斯。
Dantes.

644
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,120
我是来接你的，安吉拉。
I came to get you, Angèle.

645
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,200
对我来说，已经太晚了。
For me, it's too late.

646
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,160
但它可以拯救孩子。
But it can save the child.

647
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,290
孩子？
The child?

648
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,910
当我到达这里时，
When I arrived here,

649
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,500
我脑子里只有一个想法：
I only had one idea in mind:

650
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,120
为我的兄弟报仇。
take revenge on my brother.

651
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,700
几个星期以来，我一直在寻找
寻找逃跑的方法。
For weeks, I searched
for a way to escape.

652
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:57,540
有一天，机会来了
自我呈现。我逃跑了。
One day, the opportunity
presented itself. I ran away.

653
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,000
和一个客户。
With a client.

654
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,660
来自巴黎的木匠。
A carpenter from Paris.

655
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,500
我知道杰拉德
被任命在那里。
I knew that Gérard had
been appointed there.

656
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,750
我找到了维多利亚的踪迹
I found Victoria's trail,

657
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,250
你的爱人。
your lover.

658
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,660
我想继续
故事从哪里结束。
I wanted to continue
the story where it left off.

659
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,040
天气很冷。
It was very cold.

660
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,790
那天晚上...
That night...

661
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,410
杰拉德必须死。
Gérard would have to die.

662
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,040
没有什么可以阻止我。
Nothing could stop me.

663
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,830
我仍然能感觉到金属
我手里的刀。
I can still feel the metal
of the knife in my hand.

664
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,000
但一切都没有按计划进行。
But nothing went as planned.

665
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,290
维多利亚在哭。
Victoria's crying.

666
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:03,160
当杰拉尔走进去时
花园里，他提着一个箱子。
When Gérard went out into the
garden, he was carrying a trunk.

667
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,160
我跟着他。
I followed him.

668
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,700
当我靠近的时候……婴儿哭了
I got closer when... baby crying

669
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,830
当我听到
孩子低沉的哭声。
When I heard the
muffled cry of a child.

670
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,370
我不能离开她。
I couldn't leave her.

671
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,450
他还有他母亲的
他体内的血液。
He still had his mother's
blood in his body.

672
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,790
在复仇与生命之间……
Between revenge and life...

673
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,540
我选择了生活。
I chose life.

674
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,040
我和他一起逃跑了。
I ran away with him.

675
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,160
我在巴黎一个人也不认识。
I didn't know anyone in Paris.

676
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,790
然后我就回到了我的商店。
Then I went back to my store.

677

这疯狂的勇气之举
This act of insane courage

719

unfortunately it will not have been

注意他的财富。
So I must pay
attention to his fortune.

奖章并加一个零。
Better minus a
medal and plus a zero.

729
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,790

你在一个临时家里。

很短一段时间。
I've been in France
for a short time.

我不知道如何付款。
I already owe you a debt

把我介绍给海黛？
May I ask you to

但她是。

可以在你的过去找到。
The secret to your voice
can be found in your past.

并欢迎她。
That's where I met

807
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,870
他们在灵魂上留下一层面纱。
They leave a veil over souls.

808
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,870
切勿尝试举起
这面纱，阿尔伯特。
Never try to lift
this veil, Albert.

809
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,540
我保证。
I promise.

810
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,120
好的。
Good.

811
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,000
你会轻柔地行走，
看也不看我们一眼。
You will walk softly,
without a glance at us.

812
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,330
你只会转身
当我打电话给你的时候。
You're only going to turn
around when I call you.

813
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,080
海迪。
Haydee.

814
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,910
阿尔贝托·德·马尔塞夫
向您介绍海黛。
Alberto de Morcerf, I
present to you Haydée.

815
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:53,120
高兴极了。
Delighted.

816
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,120
着迷了。
Enchanted.

817
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,250
很高兴认识你，小姐。
Nice to meet you, miss.

818
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:01,410
如果他不这样做怎么办
想认识我吗？
What if he doesn't
want to meet me?

819
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:02,950
他会的。
He will.

820
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:06,120
起来！
Stand up!

821
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,540
站起来就是生存。
To stand is to survive.

822
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,580
隐藏我们成长的地方
贫穷，是为了生存。
Hide that we grew up in
poverty, it's about surviving.

823
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,790
你明白吗？为什么，安德烈？
Do you understand? Why, André?

824
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:17,790
因为我是王子
安德烈亚·卡瓦尔坎蒂
Because I am Prince
Andreia Cavalcanti.

825
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:21,370
- Cavalcanti，这不是山羊的意思吗？
- 什么？
- Cavalcanti, doesn't that mean goat?
- What?

826
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,450
不要感到惊讶。
听我说“什么”？
Don't be surprised.
Hear me say "what"?

827
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,620
恢复。
Resume.

828
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,620
我是王子
安德里亚·卡瓦尔坎蒂
I am the prince
Andrea Cavalcanti.

829
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:33,200
- 你没有口音
王子。这是怎么做到的？
- You don't have an accent,
prince. How is this done?

830
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,200
非常严格的老师
让我用棍子把它弄丢了。
A very strict teacher
made me lose it with a stick.

831
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,700
傲慢无礼。你的肘部。
Insolence. Your elbows.

832
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,000
亲爱的伯爵，
Dear Count,

833
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,410
- 很高兴认识你。
- 请允许我告诉你一个秘密。
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Allow me a secret.

834
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:52,410
法国人的生活仍是未知数
对我来说，请原谅我
French life is still unknown
to me, please excuse me

835
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,870
如果我的举止显得太斯拉夫式，
那不勒斯语或阿拉伯语给你。
if my manners seem too Slavic,
Neapolitan or Arabic to you.

836
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:35,250
这是基督山伯爵
和安德烈·卡瓦尔坎蒂王子。
This is the Count of Monte Cristo
and Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

837
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:39,000
- 先生们。
- 数数。
- Sirs.
- Count.

838
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:41,120
王子。
Prince.

839
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:45,080
见到你父亲，不
无论多么令人不安，
Meeting your father, no
matter how disturbing it is,

840
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,910
不应该分散你的注意力
你的目标：腾格拉尔男爵。
should not distract you from
your target: Baron Danglars.

841
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,540
多亏了被盗的船只，
在奴隶制中发了财。
Thanks to the stolen boats,
made a fortune in slavery.

842
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,000
- 你的声誉先于你。
- 不要被他的笑容所迷惑。
- Your reputation precedes you.
- Don't be fooled by his smile.

843
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:59,500
他很残酷。他不仅
知道这一点，但为此感到自豪。
He is brutal. He not only
knows this, but is proud of it.

844
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,290
我可以向你表白吗？
Can I make you a confession?

845
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:06,330
法国人的生活仍然未知
我，我会请求你原谅我
French life is still unknown to
me, I will ask you to forgive me

846
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,330
如果我的举止显得太斯拉夫式，
那不勒斯语或阿拉伯语给你。
if my manners seem too Slavic,
Neapolitan or Arabic to you.

847
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:14,620
当你有钱的时候，你可以
任何事情都不要做得太多。
When you are rich, you can
never be too much at anything.

848
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:16,040
你的女儿是
你的弱点。
Your daughter is
your weak point.

849
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,160
王子。
Prince.

850
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,750
男爵。
Baron.

851
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,450
- 尤金妮.
- 地形好不好？
- Eugénie.
- Is the terrain good?

852
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:23,040
- 太完美了。
- 那我们走吧。
- It's perfect.
- Then let's go.

853
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,790
先生们，骑马吧。
On horseback, gentlemen.

854
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:00,790
伯爵阁下。
Your Honor, Count.

855
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,540
非常感谢，
Thank you very much,

856
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,700
但我很久以前就做过了
but I did it a long time ago

857
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,540
誓杀正义
为自己辩护。
the oath to kill just
to defend myself.

858
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,700
那么让我来为你辩护吧。
So let me come to your defense.

859
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:13,950
完美的。
Perfect.

860
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,080
王子。
Prince.

861
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,540
不客气。
You're welcome.

862
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,790
我们吃午饭吧。
Let's have lunch.

863
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:19,910
尤金妮？
Eugénie?

864
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:27,000
- 谢谢。苏珊娜，我介绍
安德烈·卡瓦尔坎蒂王子，
- Thanks. Suzanne, I present
to you Prince Andrea Cavalcanti,

865
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,290
意大利门徒
基督山。
the Italian protégé
of Monte Cristo.

866
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:30,790
他照顾我。
He takes care of me.

867
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,910
我爸爸怕美女
巴黎让我做蠢事。
My father is afraid that the beauties
of Paris make me do stupid things.

868
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,750
法语说得很完美。
Speaks French perfectly.

869
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:40,500
一位非常严格的老师
我用棍子失去了我的口音。
A very strict teacher made
me lose my accent with sticks.

870
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,830
- 但这太可怕了。
- 最重要的是，这是假的。
- But it's horrible.
- It's false, above all.

871
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,290
- 我的母亲是法国人。
- 真是个白痴。
- My mother is French.
- What an idiot.

872
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,000
很高兴你能加入我们。
Glad you could join us.

873
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,790
他的门徒的手
没有颤抖。
His protégé's hand
did not tremble.

874
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,500
动物甚至没有受苦。
The animal didn't even suffer.

875
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:57,620
这是一个执行
专家与您对话。
And this is an execution
expert talking to you.

876
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,410
你经常撞头吗？
Do you often bump heads?

877
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,250
比以前少了很多。
时尚是为了放纵。
Much less than before.
Fashion is for indulgence.

878
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:08,160
我很抱歉剥夺了你伯爵的权利
但我想把你介绍给一个人。
I'm sorry for robbing you of the Count,
but I want to introduce you to someone.

879
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,450
- 先生们。
- 先生们。
- Sirs.
- Sirs.

880
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:34,410
亲爱的。
Dear.

881
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,910
最后我给大家介绍一下
基督山伯爵。
Finally, I present to you
the Count of Monte Cristo.

882
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:44,250
马尔塞夫夫人。我的敬意。
Lady of Morcerf. My respects.

883
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:49,790
一切都好吗？
Everything is fine?

884
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,580
是的...
Yes, it is...

885
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:59,000
这就是相遇的感动
没有那个你会哭泣的男人。
It's the emotion of meeting
the man you would cry without.

886
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:03,370
主啊，我欠你我儿子的命，
Lord, I owe you my son's life,

887
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,410
并为此
好处我祝福你。
and for this
benefit I bless you.

888
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:11,660
你慷慨地奖励我
一个简单的动作。
You reward me generously
for a simple action.

889
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:15,330
但我很高兴我
让他免遭痛苦。
But I'm glad I
spared him the pain.

890
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,000
我问伯爵
成为我们的客人，
I asked the count
to be our guest,

891
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,540
但到目前为止他已经拒绝了。
but so far he has refused.

892
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,200
也许你会有更好的运气？
Maybe you'll have better luck?

893
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:32,080
你能给我快乐吗？
有幸有一天成为我们的客人吗？
Will you give me the pleasure and
honor of one day being our guest?

894
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:34,370
当然，我的女士。
Certainly, my lady.

895
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,620
让我走开。我会
讨厌垄断你。
Let me move away. I would
hate to monopolize you.

896
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,160
但是……这是怎么回事？
But... what's going on?

897
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,410
你要我打电话给某人吗？
Do you want me to call someone?

898
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,660
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

899
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,290
你对这个人了解多少？
What do you know about this man?

900
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
母亲。
Mother.

901
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:09,120
你总是疑心重重
我的新认识的人，
You are always suspicious
of my new acquaintances,

902
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:11,120
但伯爵救了我的命。
but the count saved my life.

903
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,910
他像国王一样富有。
He's as rich as a king.

904
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,500
我应该害怕他什么？
What should I fear from him?

905
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,870
你说得对。
You're right.

906
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,080
我的恐惧是愚蠢的。
My terrors are foolish.

907
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,120
金先生的律师，
Mr. King's attorney,

908
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,750
以我的名义，
皇家陆军中尉，
It is on my honor, as
lieutenant of the royal armies,

909
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:42,620
我在这里证明
爱德蒙·唐太斯这个名字
that I attest here that
the name Edmond Dantès

910
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:45,620
在我面前作证
曾多次
testified in my presence
on several occasions

911
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:47,620
对篡位者的同情
of sympathy for the usurper

912
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:51,580
以及他想要承担的愿望
武装推翻君主制。
and his desire to take up
arms to overthrow the monarchy.

913
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,790
这些话让我印象深刻，因为
爱德蒙唐太斯是我的朋友，
These words impress me because
Edmond Dantès was my friend,

914
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:57,750
但我不能让这个
犯罪逍遥法外。
But I cannot let this
crime go unpunished.

915
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:01,250
我见过很多人死去
因为背叛国家的人。
I have seen many men die
because of traitors to the country.

916
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:04,250
不是这样的
你要睡觉了。
That's not how
you're going to sleep.

917
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:06,250
我不是在寻找那个。
I wasn't looking for that.

918
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:10,040
你害怕吗
你的噩梦？
Are you afraid of
your nightmares?

919
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,160
恐怕我不会
有了它了。
I'm afraid I won't
have it anymore.

920
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:19,580
他们帮助我保持
我的伤口张开。
They help me keep
my wounds open.

921
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:25,620
你又看到这个了吗？
Have you seen this again?

922
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,120
是的。
Yes.

923
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,000
她有那么美丽吗
正如他记得的那样？
Was she as beautiful
as he remembered?

924
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,370
我以为痛苦
会改变她的。
I thought the pain
would have changed her.

925
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,540
它一定是短暂的。
It must have been short-lived.

926
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:50,450
她的眼睛不像
经常哭的女人。
Her eyes were not those of a
woman who was crying a lot.

927
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:01,370
- 她会重新尝到眼泪的味道
当她的丈夫被从她身边夺走时。
- She will regain the taste for tears
when her husband is taken from her.

928
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,750
我通过了。
I pass.

929
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:32,790
200...
200...

930
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:34,750
超过500个。
more than 500.

931
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,200
我放弃。
I give up.

932
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:40,370
我不会邀请你来我的
如果你知道怎么玩的话。
I wouldn't invite you to my
table if you knew how to play.

933
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,790
然后。
Then.

934
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:45,580
我们只剩下三个人了。
There are only three of us left.

935
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,080
我会让你独自一人。
I'll leave you alone.

936
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,000
两对。
Two pairs.

937
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,500
好工作。
Good job.

938
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:00,750
颜色。
Color.

939
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,450
它有很多颗心。
It has many hearts.

940
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,540
我要逃跑
在我毁了我父亲之前。
I'm going to run away
before I ruin my father.

941
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,450
- 来吧，艾伯特。
- 是的，就是这样，
- Come on, Albert.
- Yes, that's it,

942
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:13,200
- 去看看这些女士们。
- 游戏中不快乐，爱情中快乐。
- Go see these ladies.
- Unhappy in the game, happy in love.

943
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,700
我非常喜欢你的王子。
I like your prince very much.

944
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,620
他很有魅力。
He's charming.

945
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,370
老实说，我几乎不认识他。
你父亲是商业关系。
I barely know him, to be honest.
Your father is a business relationship.

946
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,000
一个美好的家庭，这是毫无疑问的。
A good family, without a doubt.

947
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,790
如果“好”意味着“富有”，
是的，这是意大利的第二财富。
If by “good” is meant “rich”,
yes, it is Italy's second fortune.

948
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,040
唔...
Hmm...

949
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,950
第二个？
The second?

950
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:38,540
那么你知道第一个吗？
So do you know the first one?

951
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,660
别让我不谦虚。
Don't make me immodest.

952
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,790
嗯，比我有钱的人。
Well, people richer than me.

953
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:49,040
他的家人梦想看到
他在巴黎娶了一个女孩，但是……
His family dreams of seeing
him marry a girl in Paris, but...

954
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,330
如果儿子也这么善变
作为父亲，要小心。
If the son is as fickle
as the father, be careful.

955
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,200
放心，
Rest assured,

956
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,080
总的来说，我不信任每个人。
I distrust everyone in general.

957
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:00,250
还有来自外国人的，
尤其。
And from foreigners,
in particular.

958
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,160
我也是外国人。
I am also a foreigner.

959
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,410
你，伯爵，那不是
数数。你是一位伯爵。
You, Count, that doesn't
count. You are a Count.

960
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,830
而且还押韵，你见过吗？
And it rhymes, have you seen it?

961
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,910
你是一位诗人。
You are a poet.

962
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,120
关于外国人，
About the foreigner,

963
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:14,450
公正党被收购
由一个英国人。
L'Impartial was bought
by an Englishman.

964
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:15,790
绝对地，
Absolutely,

965
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:18,870
某个哈利法克斯。
看来只有一位主。
a certain Halifax.
One Lord, it seems.

966
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,790
他买报纸
传播假新闻
He buys newspapers
to spread fake news

967
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:25,250
并推测
股票市场。
and speculate on
the stock market.

968
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:27,370
他是一个罪犯
最糟糕的一种。
He's a criminal
of the worst kind.

969
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:31,540
他似乎没有
非常喜欢这位主。
He doesn't seem to
like this Lord very much.

970
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:34,160
就说我爱吧
很多人，
Let's say I love
a lot of people,

971
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:37,000
但我只讨厌某些人。
but I only hate certain people.

972
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:40,540
讨厌英国人是
不是罪过。这是常识。
Hating an Englishman is
not a sin. It's common sense.

973
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,120
你已经走了吗？
Are you leaving already?

974
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:49,870
已经快半夜了。我们的
马车会变成南瓜。
It's almost midnight. Our
carriage will become a pumpkin.

975
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,410
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

976
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,830
错过。
Miss.

977
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,790
我差点忘了你的扇子。
I was going to forget your fan.

978
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,080
谢谢您，先生。
Thank you, sir.

979
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:14,580
- 我可以依靠你吗？
- 为了？
- Can I count on you?
- For?

980
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,910
和你一起吃晚饭
Join you for dinner

981
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:20,370
即将抵达巴黎。
我找到了住的地方。
coming soon to Paris.
I found a place to stay.

982
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,700
嗯...当然，先生。
Well... Of course sir.

983
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,540
好的。
Good.

984
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:27,910
再见。
See you soon.

985
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:36,700
数数。
Count.

986
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,870
马尔塞夫夫人。
Lady of Morcerf.

987
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:42,700
当我到达时它就离开了。
It left when I arrived.

988
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:44,620
我没有看到任何
连接那里。
I don't see any
connection there.

989
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,870
我想问
你的宽恕。
I wanted to ask for
your forgiveness.

990
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,500
请求我原谅？
Ask me for forgiveness?

991
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:54,330
因为我那天头晕。
For my dizziness the other day.

992
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,040
这让我想起了一个我
很清楚谁去世了
It reminded me of someone I
knew well who passed away

993
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,910
在悲惨的情况下。
in tragic circumstances.

994
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,790
一瞬间，我...
For a moment, I...

995
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,540
又要开始了，我不行了
不再找到我的话...
It's starting again, I can't
find my words anymore...

996
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:22,700
抱歉提醒
你那段糟糕的记忆。
I'm sorry to remind
you of that bad memory.

997
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,660
别担心，已经消散了。
Don't worry, it dissipated.

998
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,330
好多了。
So much better.

999
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,790
祝你晚安。
I wish you a good night.

1000
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,200
数数。
Count.

1001
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,950
马车开走了。
The carriage moves away.

1002
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,080
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

1003
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:07,620
“海迪。
“Haydee.

1004
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,450
“我不应该给你写信。
所以我不会写信给你。
“I shouldn't write to you.
So I'm not writing to you.

1005
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:14,700
“我不应该认识你……”
"I shouldn't know you..."

1006
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:18,200
因此我并不建议
你们在植物园相遇，
I am therefore not suggesting that
you meet at the Jardin des Plantes,

1007
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,040
明天 5 点。
tomorrow at 5 o'clock.

1008
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:22,750
这个地方，我
不会是明天，
This place, where I
won't be tomorrow,

1009
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:25,500
包含最多的
巴黎的神秘花朵。
contains the most
mysterious flowers in Paris.

1010
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:30,370
它来自一个绰号为“
云与茉莉花之地。
It comes from a country nicknamed
the land of clouds and jasmine.

1011
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,660
我们可以信赖
巴黎的天空云彩，
We can count on the
Paris sky for clouds,

1012
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:35,700
我会把茉莉花放在我的翻领上。
I'll put jasmine in my lapel.

1013
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:38,200
所以我不会告诉
你直到明天。
So I won't tell
you until tomorrow.

1014
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,830
而我并没有告诉过
自从我见到你之后你就这样了
And I haven't been telling
you this since I saw you,

1015
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,120
你的声音和你的
脸永远不会离开我。
your voice and your
face never leave me.

1016
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:45,750
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

1017
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,870
他不会举报我们吗？
Won't he report us?

1018
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,790
他对伯爵非常忠诚
He is very loyal to the count,

1019
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:57,200
但他对我有一个弱点。
but he has a weakness for me.

1020
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,040
这是鹤望兰。
It's a strelitzia.

1021
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,580
我来自哪里，那里就有
有些在通向大海的小路上。
Where I come from, there were
some on a path that leads to the sea.

1022
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,910
它也被称为
天堂鸟，
It is also called
the bird of paradise,

1023
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,580
帕萨雷亚天堂。
pasărea paradisului.

1024
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,700
帕萨雷亚帕迪苏鲁伊？
Passarea paradisului?

1025
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,370
好的。
Good.

1026
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:25,500
他为什么没有新娘？
Why doesn't he have a bride?

1027
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,700
但也许有一个？
But maybe there is one?

1028
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,450
我父亲希望我
娶男爵的女儿。
My father would like me to
marry a Baron's daughter.

1029
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,410
但我...
But I...

1030
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:36,450
我正在寻找这个东西
年轻女人永远不会有。
I'm looking for something this
young woman will never have.

1031
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:42,870
这……无限的魅力就是
女人就像香水之于鲜花。
This... indefinite charm that is to
women what perfume is to flowers.

1032
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,450
或者水果的味道如何。
Or what the fruit tastes like.

1033
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:50,160
不知道巴黎人有没有
喜欢被捕捉或品尝，
I don't know if Parisians
like to be caught or tasted,

1034
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,330
但不是我。
but not me.

1035
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:55,290
- 我不是这个意思。
- 我在和你开玩笑。
- That's not what I meant.
- I was joking with you.

1036
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,540
将会在晚餐时
算星期六吗？
Will be at dinner
Count on Saturday?

1037
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,450
不，我将担任
我母亲的不在场证明
No. I'll serve as an
alibi for my mother

1038
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:03,950
谁逃离世俗
就像瘟疫一样。
who flees worldliness
like the plague.

1039
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:05,330
你呢？
And you?

1040
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:08,290
我不认识你妈妈
I don't know your mother,

1041
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,790
我不知道什么
她的品味是
I don't know what
her tastes are,

1042
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,750
但我和你一样厌恶。
But I share your disgust.

1043
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:20,080
无论是他还是他的
妈妈会来吃晚饭。
Neither he nor his
mother will come to dinner.

1044
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:23,330
但费尔南德
马尔塞夫将会在那里。
But Fernand de
Morcerf will be there.

1045
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,910
有什么问题吗？
What's the problem?

1046
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,870
你不是在说话吗
给我关于艾伯特的事？
Aren't you talking
to me about Albert?

1047
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,330
什么都没有
说到这一点。
There's nothing
to say about that.

1048
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,250
有怀疑是很正常的。
It's normal to doubt.

1049
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,870
害怕。我明白这一点。
Be afraid. I understand that.

1050
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,200
但当时机到来时，
你需要记住...
But when the time comes,
you need to remember...

1051
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,870
我不需要
I don't need

1052
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,700
提醒我什么
他父亲对我做了。
to remind me of what
his father did to mine.

1053
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,160
他把嘴唇放在那里。
He placed his lips there.

1054
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,330
谢谢
Thanks

1055
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,830
- 非常昂贵。
- 当然。
- Very expensive.
- Of course.

1056
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,950
亲爱的朋友们。
Dear friends.

1057
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:55,750
晚上好，维多利亚。
Good evening, Victoria.

1058
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,120
我也期待着
更加壮观，
I also expected
more spectacular,

1059
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:04,000
没有意义
在做那张脸时。
There's no point
in making that face.

1060
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,660
肯定会有
里面会有惊喜。
There will definitely
be surprises inside.

1061
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,660
宝宝在哭。
The baby is crying.

1062
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:25,620
唔...
Hmm...

1063
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:33,250
他似乎没有
胃口很大。
He doesn't seem to
have much of an appetite.

1064
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,750
我吃过猪肉和家禽。
I've eaten pork and poultry.

1065
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:40,370
这房子……很漂亮。
This house is... beautiful.

1066
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,040
尽管发生了一切，
我感到很惊讶。
Despite everything,
I feel surprised.

1067
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:45,040
没有什么能逃过他的眼睛。
Nothing escapes him.

1068
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:51,040
我以为像你这样的男人会
选择更中心的街区，
I thought a man like you would
choose a more central neighborhood,

1069
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:54,660
就像……香榭丽舍大街
或圣日耳曼。
like... the Champs-Elysées
or Saint-Germain.

1070
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:58,000
我买这个房子是因为
有人建议我不要这样做。
I bought this house because
I was advised against it.

1071
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:59,620
为了什么？
For what?

1072
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:03,660
嗯，他们说这里闹鬼。
Well, they say it's haunted.

1073
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:08,000
犯罪将会发生
那里……可恶，几年前。
A crime would have happened
there... Abominable, years ago.

1074
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,790
小心点，我们有
国王检察官在这里。
Be careful, we have the
King's Procurator here.

1075
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:11,790
和真相。
And truth.

1076
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,080
一个孩子将会有
被牺牲了。
A child will have
been sacrificed.

1077
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:18,080
太可怕了。
It's horrible.

1078
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:21,410
你到底买了这个房子吗？
Did you buy this house anyway?

1079
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,910
你做得很好。
You did well.

1080
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,910
这些鬼故事纯属无稽之谈
These ghost stories are nonsense

1081
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,290
由恶意的仆人发明的。
invented by malicious servants.

1082
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:29,790
或者嫉妒的邻居。
Or jealous neighbors.

1083
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:32,370
再想一想，检察官。
Think again, Prosecutor.

1084
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:35,000
我住在亚洲和印度，
I lived in Asia and India,

1085
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,540
很难再回来
不知道它确实存在
and it's hard to come back from
this without knowing that it really exists

1086
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,910
一个世界...
a world...

1087
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,450
看不见的，充满了灵魂。
invisible, populated by spirits.

1088
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:47,410
当我参观这所房子时，...
When I visited this house,...

1089
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,540
我立刻就知道了...
I knew immediately...

1090
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:55,200
我有一种奇怪的信念
这里曾发生过犯罪行为。
I had the strange conviction that
a crime had been committed here.

1091
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,870
所以我问
So I asked

1092
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,290
- 直到我独自一人。
- 但...
- until I'm alone.
- But...

1093
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,660
你不害怕吗？
weren't you scared?

1094
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,870
如果你的良心是纯洁的，
鬼魂不会困扰你。
If your conscience is pure,
ghosts don't haunt you.

1095
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,000
他们跟你说话。
They talk to you.

1096
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:12,120
-他们告诉你什么了？
- 但是，是的，他们告诉了你什么？
-And what did they tell you?
- But yes, what did they tell you?

1097
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:19,540
那天晚上，我就定居在这里。
That night, I settled here.

1098
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,870
就在前面
那个壁炉的。
Right in front
of that fireplace.

1099
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:26,910
我吸了一点鸦片
变得更容易接受。
I smoked a little opium
to be more receptive.

1100
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:31,120
没有什么比它更能扩展
你的意识范围。
There is nothing like it to expand
the spectrum of your consciousness.

1101
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,160
而在甜蜜中
烟雾的...
And in the sweetness
of the smoke...

1102
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:41,540
我感觉就像……暂停了。
I felt like... suspended.

1103
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,040
我听到敲墙声。
I hear a knock on the walls.

1104
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,700
然后一秒钟。
Then a second.

1105
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:53,790
我放下手。
I lowered my hand.

1106
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,620
我听到尖叫声传来
从上面。我走上楼梯。
And I hear screams coming
from above. I go up the stairs.

1107
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:03,250
尖叫声变成了……呻吟。
The screams turn into... moans.

1108
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,750
来自一个房间
Comes from a room

1109
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:08,080
在走廊的尽头。
at the end of the corridor.

1110
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:13,080
我推门然后
发现自己在一个房间里。
I push the door and
find myself in a room.

1111
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,750
中间有一张床。
In the middle there is a bed.

1112
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:16,370
我把手放在那里。
I put my hand there.

1113
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:21,950
我看到一个女人
痛苦地翻滚。
And I see a woman
writhing in pain.

1114
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:27,660
她生下了一个孩子。
她孤身一人，被抛弃了。
She gives birth to a child.
She's alone, abandoned.

1115
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,870
她尖叫起来。
She screams.

1116
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:34,450
然后我感觉
在我背后的存在。
And then I feel a
presence behind my back.

1117
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,200
突然。
Suddenly.

1118
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,040
你吓坏了这些女士。
You terrify these ladies.

1119
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,750
你让我们着迷。
And you enchant us.

1120
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,950
继续吧，我求你了。
Carry on, I beg you.

1121
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,330
来吧，你是
破坏聚会。
Come on, you're
ruining the party.

1122
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:50,660
我转过身，浑身发抖。
I turn around, shaking.

1123
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:53,580
而此时此刻，
And at this moment,

1124
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:56,790
我听到耳边有声音。
I hear a whisper in my ear.

1125
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,080
这是一个孩子的声音。
It's a child's voice.

1126
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,370
一个孩子的声音在哀求我
A child's voice begging me

1127
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:04,660
释放他。
to free him.

1128
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,580
终于找到了一扇门，
Finally I found a door,

1129
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,580
我没见过的后门。
a back door I hadn't seen.

1130
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:13,660
我推她。
I push her.

1131
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:17,160
楼梯...通向花园。
Stairs... Lead to the garden.

1132
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:20,750
而她回来了，
孩子的声音。
And she came back,
the child's voice.

1133
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:25,040
他告诉我他一直孤身一人
许久。他在哭。
He told me he had been alone
for a long time. He was crying.

1134
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:26,910
他打电话给他的母亲。
He calls his mother.

1135
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,500
那天晚上，我...
That night, I...

1136
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:35,950
我看了看，但是……
I looked, but...

1137
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:39,200
花园很大。
the garden was very big.

1138
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,790
什么...你做了什么？
What... What did you do?

1139
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,200
饶恕？
Forgiveness?

1140
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:56,000
花园很大...
The garden was very big...

1141
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,330
你做了什么？
What did you do?

1142
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:01,450
是的。
Yes.

1143
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,330
第二天早上我们就挖了。
The next morning we dug.

1144
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:16,040
到处。
Everywhere.

1145
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:20,040
我们把苹果连根拔起
树，我返回了路径......
We uprooted the apple
trees, I returned the path...

1146
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:21,870
什么也没有。
And nothing.

1147
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:27,450
所以我带了一块松露
来自佩里戈尔的猪。
So I brought a truffled
pig from Périgord.

1148
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:30,120
所以呢？
So what?

1149
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,120
既然他没有
找到任何东西，
Since he didn't
find anything either,

1150
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,660
我们今晚吃了饭。
we ate tonight.

1151
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:39,750
精彩的！
Wonderful!

1152
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:44,370
我说这只是一个寓言。
I said it was just a fable.

1153
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,160
确切地说，是一个寓言。
A fable, exactly.

1154
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,000
至少我是这样的
想法。直到昨天。
At least that's what I
thought. Until yesterday.

1155
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:54,160
当我们被殖民时
While we were colonized

1156
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:56,410
接待处的火把，
the torches for the reception,

1157
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,160
其中一个坏了。
one of them broke.

1158
01:53:00,870 --> 01:53:03,000
我们在那里挖了然后...
We dug there and...

1159
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:05,750
我们发现了一个箱子。
we discovered a chest.

1160
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,370
所以呢？
So what?

1161
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,830
里面是什么？
What was inside?

1162
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,750
我不知道。
I don't know.

1163
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:14,790
像这样？
Like this?

1164
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,540
我等着它……打开。
I waited for it... to open.

1165
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
如果有尸体怎么办？
What if there is a body?

1166
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,750
我们将为您举行葬礼。
We will give you a burial.

1167
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:49,160
检察官，你可能希望
Prosecutor, you may wish

1168
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:50,330
打开它？
open it?

1169
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,410
- 我求你了，别打开它。
- 够了。
- I beg you, don't open it.
- That's enough.

1170
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:20,950
胡言乱语！
Abracadabra!

1171
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,160
哦，我不知道
Oh, I don't know

1172
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:29,290
这就是这个故事中的真实情况，
但你是一个魔术师，
which is true in this story,
but you are a magician,

1173
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:30,700
数数。
Count.

1174
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,790
怎么可能呢？他
说话就好像他就在场一样。
How is it possible? He
spoke as if he were there.

1175
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:43,290
所有这些细节...我
我以为我要疯了。
All these details were... I
thought I was going crazy.

1176
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,200
请冷静。
Calm down, please.

1177
01:54:45,370 --> 01:54:47,750
- 我们儿子的尸体在哪里？
- 我不知道。
- Where is our son's body?
- I don't know.

1178
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:49,660
- 你把它放在那里了吗？
- 是的。
- Did you put it there?
- Yes.

1179
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,700
你告诉我他是
死的！你告诉我了！
You told me he was
dead! You told me!

1180
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:54,500
他当然死了。
Of course he was dead.

1181
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:57,000
- 那么他在哪里？
- 我不知道。
- So where is he?
- I don't know.

1182
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:59,200
- 我们的儿子在哪里？
- 我不知道！
- Where is our son?
- I don't know!

1183
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:02,790
闭嘴，你是
歇斯底里！我不知道。
Shut up, you're
hysterical! I don't know.

1184
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:05,080
冷静下来。
Calm down.

1185
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:08,290
我知道一件事。
I know one thing.

1186
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:10,500
只是这样
八天前，
It's just that
before eight days,

1187
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:13,040
我会知道这是谁
基督山先生是，
I will know who this
Mr. Monte Cristo is,

1188
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:16,410
它从哪里来
从哪里来，到哪里去，
where it comes
from, where it goes,

1189
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:20,290
以及为什么他在众人面前讲话
我们谈论我们埋葬的孩子们。
and why he talks in front of
us about the children we buried.

1190
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:26,330
腾格拉尔痴迷于金钱。
Danglars is obsessed with money.

1191
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,950
他不会怀疑
He won't suspect

1192
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,040
来自那些不这样做的人
要求它。马尔塞夫
from those who don't
ask for it. Morcerf

1193
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
相信我，因为我救了你的儿子。
Trust me since I saved your son.

1194
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:33,500
维尔福依然存在。
Villefort remains.

1195
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:35,370
维尔福是检察官。
Villefort is the Prosecutor.

1196
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,580
他很怀疑。
He is suspicious.

1197
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:41,580
也感谢这顿晚餐，
维多利亚将要求做出解释。
And thanks to this dinner,
Victoria will demand explanations.

1198
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,120
所以为了让她放心
并安慰自己，
So, to reassure her
and reassure herself,

1199
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:45,830
他会调查。
he will investigate.

1200
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:50,250
正如我们一直学习的那样
更多来自恶意之口，
And as we always learn
more from malicious mouths,

1201
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,700
这是伯爵的
他将看到的敌人。
it is the Count's
enemy that he will see.

1202
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:54,700
哈利法克斯先生。
Mr Halifax.

1203
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,250
你想知道什么？
What do you want to know?

1204
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:01,870
如果我可以伤害你
这将是一种乐趣。
If I can harm you,
it will be a pleasure.

1205
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,450
计数已经
去过巴黎吗？他声称没有。
The count has already
been in Paris? He claims no.

1206
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:09,620
如果他已经
在这里，我会知道。
If he was already
here, I would know.

1207
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:13,910
但那么你知道吗
15年前他在哪里？
But then, do you know
where he was 15 years ago?

1208
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:16,450
是的。在印度。
Yes. In India.

1209
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:18,750
但...
But...

1210
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:20,200
我必须说，
I must say,

1211
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,410
当时他还逗我笑。
At the time, he still amused me.

1212
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,660
但后来...
But then...

1213
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:29,950
然后呢？
Then what?

1214
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:35,120
有一天晚上我在
纠正仆人
One night I was
correcting a servant

1215
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:37,120
谁找得好。
who had looked for it well.

1216
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,120
但...
But...

1217
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:43,450
基督山开发了
对这些野蛮人的热情，
Monte Cristo developed a
passion for these savages,

1218
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:48,500
和它的异教诸神，
这是荒谬的魔法。
with its pagan gods,
its absurd magic.

1219
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,160
可笑的信念。
Ridiculous beliefs.

1220
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:54,540
然后他向我发起决斗挑战。
Then he challenged me to a duel.

1221
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:56,660
是本地人做的吗？
By a native?

1222
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:59,910
但是是的！本地人！
But yes! A native!

1223
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,700
你能相信吗？
Can you believe it?

1224
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:03,950
哦。
Oh.

1225
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:07,080
天气很热，你不
思考？多热啊！
It's hot, don't you
think? How hot!

1226
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,120
我被带到我的粉丝身边，
为了天堂的爱！
I am brought to my fan,
for the love of heaven!

1227
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,700
我们在这里快要窒息了！
We're suffocating here!

1228
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:16,370
不是这个。
Not this one.

1229
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:18,080
谢谢。
Thanks.

1230
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,700
唔。你呢，
Hmm. And you,

1231
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,250
维尔福勋爵？
Lord de Villefort?

1232
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,410
他对你做了什么？
What did he do to you?

1233
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
没有什么。
Nothing.

1234
01:57:31,370 --> 01:57:34,700
我不知道我是否应该考虑
他在我的朋友或我的敌人中。
I don't know whether I should consider
him among my friends or among my enemies.

1235
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:39,540
如果他是你的敌人
你应该已经知道了。
If he were your enemy,
you would already know that.

1236
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:43,750
他有缺点，但他没有
一个隐藏自己意图的人。
He has flaws, but he is not
a man to hide his intentions.

1237
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:44,910
唔。
Hmm.

1238
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:46,580
但...
But...

1239
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:48,580
小心。
take care.

1240
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,000
检察官先生。
Mr Prosecutor.

1241
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,200
如果他成为你的朋友，
If he becomes your friend,

1242
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,870
那会让你成为我的敌人。
that will make you my enemy.

1243
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,910
当然。
Of course.

1244
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:10,370
是的。
Yes.

1245
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:13,500
谢谢德先生
维尔福，非常愉快
Thank you, Mr. de
Villefort, It was very pleasant

1246
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:16,580
与您讨论,
但我还有很多事要做。
discuss with you,
but I have a lot to do.

1247
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,910
谢谢。
Thanks.

1248
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:20,910
检察官先生。
Mr Prosecutor.

1249
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,200
胜利者。
Victor.

1250
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,040
数数？
Count?

1251
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,290
准备
马，我们回去吧。
Prepare the
horses, let's go back.

1252
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:49,660
现在维尔福
放松了警惕，
Now that Villefort
has let his guard down,

1253
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:52,160
我们可以准备进攻了。
we can prepare our attack.

1254
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,910
我要去南方。
I'm going south.

1255
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:58,700
我要回去参加腾格拉尔的派对
为他女儿20岁生日。
I'm going back to Danglars' party
for his daughter's 20th birthday.

1256
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,410
我指望你，
I'm counting on you,

1257
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:02,580
安德烈，为了离她更近一些。
André, to get closer to her.

1258
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:06,330
而你，海黛，
迷惑阿尔伯特。
And in you, Haydée,
to bewitch Albert.

1259
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,160
前进。
Go ahead.

1260
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:14,000
好的。
Good.

1261
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:18,120
最多可容纳600人
黑人，700 有点推动，但是......
It can accommodate up to 600
blacks, 700 pushing a little, but...

1262
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:20,080
我是一个人文主义者。
I am a humanist.

1263
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,750
我称他为赫拉克勒斯。
I called him Hercules.

1264
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:26,450
我妈说这是血统
注定成就伟大事业的人。
My mother said this is the lineage
of people destined for great things.

1265
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,580
这就是你的……爱情短语。
And that's your... love phrase.

1266
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,790
然后我读到了这个...
And then I read this...

1267
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,540
我必须告诉你一件事。
I have to tell you something.

1268
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,500
是的？
Yes?

1269
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:49,040
我愿意爱你，
I would like to love you,

1270
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:52,120
- 但我不能。
- 我知道。
- but I can't.
- I know.

1271
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:56,200
你不会向我提供
You won't offer me

1272
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:58,620
他对苏珊娜的感情。
the feelings he has for Suzanne.

1273
01:59:58,790 --> 02:00:00,000
这将是我们的秘密。
It will be our secret.

1274
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:02,830
这将是我们的秘密。
它将被妥善保存。
It will be our secret.
It will be well kept.

1275
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,250
我知道那是什么
喜欢成双。
I know what it's
like to be double.

1276
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,910
我知道那是什么
喜欢成双。
I know what it's
like to be double.

1277
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,000
因无法
说出我们是谁。
Of not being able
to say who we are.

1278
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:14,620
我会成为你的不在场证明。
I'll be your alibi.

1279
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,250
时机已到
来救赎自己。
The time has come
to redeem yourself.

1280
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:15,080
听不见的话
Inaudible words

1281
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,040
我又活在梦里了
I live again in dreams

1282
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,370
这些的每一秒
和你在一起的时刻。
every second of these
moments with you.

1283
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:53,790
我会带走记忆
你的眼睛进入我的夜晚，
I will take the memory
of your eyes into my night,

1284
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:56,620
我不想
与任何人交谈
and I don't want
to talk to anyone

1285
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:58,910
以免浪费
你话语的回声
so as not to waste
the echo of your words

1286
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,830
至今仍在我心中颤抖。
that still trembles in my heart.

1287
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,450
我保留你的单子
音乐离我很近。
I keep your sheet
music close to me.

1288
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,250
我喜欢这个形象
你给我你，
I love the image
you give me of you,

1289
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:12,200
但也最重要的是
她将永远铭记的记忆
but also and above all for the
memory that she will carry forever,

1290
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:15,790
生命中的某个时刻
那是值得一生的。
that of a moment in life
that is worth a lifetime.

1291
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,950
嗡嗡声
buzz

1292
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,660
- 稍后见。
- 稍后见。
- See you later.
- See you later.

1293
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:08,290
王子。
Prince.

1294
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:15,580
尤金妮.这个聚会是在
你的形象，生机勃勃，充满欢乐。
Eugénie. This party is in
your image, alive and joyful.

1295
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,580
谢谢你，安德里亚。
Thank you, Andrea.

1296
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,830
它将包括计数
您的客人中有基督山吗？
It will include the Count of
Monte Christ among your guests?

1297
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:22,580
17.
17.

1298
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:23,870
17？
17?

1299
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:27,120
你是第17个
问我这个问题。
You are the 17th to
ask me the question.

1300
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:29,250
大家的回答是什么？
And what does everyone answer?

1301
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,700
那将会有
没有18号。就在那里。
That there will be
no 18th. There it is.

1302
02:03:37,290 --> 02:03:38,250
- 打扰一下。
- Excuse me.

1303
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:44,910
错过。
miss.

1304
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:48,370
- 数数。 你的旅行还顺利吗？
- 太棒了。
- Count. Did your trip go well?
- Wonderfully.

1305
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:52,080
- 谢谢。
- 尤金妮很不耐烦
- Thanks.
- Eugénie is impatient

1306
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,870
再次见到你，小姐。
to see you again, miss.

1307
02:03:54,330 --> 02:03:55,910
伯爵，你允许我吗？
Count, will you allow me?

1308
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,040
快乐是我的。
The pleasure is mine.

1309
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:08,950
伯爵知道吗
我们看到对方了吗？
Does the count know
we saw each other?

1310
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:11,000
我什么也没告诉你。
I didn't tell you anything.

1311
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:16,000
- 他能猜到吗？
- 只有上帝知道他的能力。
- Could he have guessed?
- Only God knows what he is capable of.

1312
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:19,370
它们很漂亮，不是吗？
They're beautiful, aren't they?

1313
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:23,290
他们看起来非常渴望生活。
They seem so eager to live.

1314
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,540
我们始终在
急着要快乐。
We are always in
a hurry to be happy.

1315
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,500
不？
No?

1316
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:34,450
请赐予我你的手臂的荣誉。
Do me the honor of your arm.

1317
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:36,580
我想采取一些措施。
I want to take some steps.

1318
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,160
你的手在颤抖。
Your hand is shaking.

1319
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,620
他似乎很冷。
He seems to be cold.

1320
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:22,660
我们家有，
手冰冷，心却温暖。
We have, in my family,
cold hands but warm heart.

1321
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:25,830
这里。这会让我们温暖起来。
Here. That will warm us up.

1322
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:28,910
我们的葡萄是
比西西里岛还糟糕
Our grapes are
worse than in Sicily

1323
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:32,000
但会很宽容
与我们北方的太阳。
but it will be lenient
with our northern sun.

1324
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:33,580
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1325
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:38,040
请原谅我，但是……
Please forgive me, but...

1326
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:40,250
我从来不喝酒。
I never drink.

1327
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:44,660
你要吃点东西吗？
Are you going to eat something?

1328
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,000
我又得拒绝了
I'll have to refuse again.

1329
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:55,200
康德先生，有一个阿拉伯人
结交永远朋友的习俗
Mr. Conde, there is an Arab
custom that makes friends forever

1330
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:58,410
那些分享面包的人
和盐在同一屋檐下。
those who shared bread
and salt under the same roof.

1331
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:00,830
我认识你，女士。
I know you, ma'am.

1332
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:04,080
但我们在巴黎
而不是丹吉尔。
But we are in Paris
and not Tangier.

1333
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:09,410
不再有永恒的友谊
在这里比分享面包和盐更重要。
There is no more eternal friendship
here than sharing bread and salt.

1334
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:34,450
但最后...我们
朋友们，不是吗？
But finally... We're
friends, aren't we?

1335
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,580
但绝对是。
But definitely.

1336
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,250
我们为什么不呢？
Why wouldn't we be?

1337
02:06:43,450 --> 02:06:48,370
所以，在没有面包的情况下，
盐，与我分享一些回忆。
So, in the absence of bread and
salt, Share with me some memories.

1338
02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:52,700
你想知道什么？
What do you want to know?

1339
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,410
确实，看了这么多，
It's true that you saw so much,

1340
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:59,370
我旅行了那么多，
I traveled so much,

1341
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:00,870
受了这么多苦？
suffered so much?

1342
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:03,330
是什么让你这么说？
What makes you say that?

1343
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:06,290
你的眼睛。
Your eyes.

1344
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:13,040
每个旅人心里都有
渴望找到或逃避某事。
In every traveler there is the
desire to find or escape something.

1345
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,000
你找到了吗？
Did you find it?

1346
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:19,330
我还没有完成我的旅行。
I haven't finished my trip yet.

1347
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:26,080
你独自生活吗？
Do you live alone?

1348
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:31,290
我没有妹妹
既不是儿子，也不是父亲。
I don't have a sister,
neither son nor father.

1349
02:07:35,370 --> 02:07:39,830
我只有海黛，
我确信，很快就会离开我。
I only have Haydée who,
I'm sure, will leave me soon.

1350
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,830
你怎么能这样生活
How can you live like this,

1351
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,910
没有任何东西
将你与生活联系起来？
without anything to
connect you to life?

1352
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,000
我爱过一个年轻女孩。
I loved a young girl.

1353
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:57,370
说我要结婚了。
That I was going to get married.

1354
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,620
几年前。
Years ago.

1355
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:05,830
但当战争来临的时候
并把我从它身边带走...
But when the war came
and took me away from it...

1356
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:12,620
我以为她会爱
我足够等我了。
I thought she would love
me enough to wait for me.

1357
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,700
保持忠诚
对我来说，直到坟墓。
To remain faithful
to me until the grave.

1358
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,040
但当我回来后，
But when I came back,

1359
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,450
结婚了。
was married.

1360
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:35,370
也许他有更弱的
心比别人强。
Maybe he had a weaker
heart than the others.

1361
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:40,080
我所受的苦超过
他们会受苦的
I suffered more than
they would have suffered

1362
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,500
- 就这样。
——这份爱还留在你心里吗？
- That's all.
- Did this love remain in your heart?

1363
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:49,700
我们只真正喜欢过一次。
We only really loved it once.

1364
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:52,000
不？
No?

1365
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:56,200
你又见到她了吗？
Did you see her again?

1366
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:01,620
绝不。
Never.

1367
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:04,000
绝不？
Never?

1368
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,700
绝不。
Never.

1369
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:19,290
你原谅了吗
他的痛苦？
Did you forgive
him his suffering?

1370
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:24,750
我们只能原谅那些
谁请求我们宽恕。
We can only forgive those
who ask us for forgiveness.

1371
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,870
如果她问你怎么办
今天求宽恕吗？
What if she asked you
for forgiveness today?

1372
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:52,830
- 购买 L'Impartial！舰队
腾格拉尔从马赛被盗！
- Buy L'Impartial! The fleet
Danglars stolen from Marseille!

1373
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,500
不偏不倚，女士们，
先生们！公正！
L'Impartial, ladies and
gentlemen! L'Impartial!

1374
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:57,660
买！
Buy!

1375
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:01,040
船怎么会被偷
光天化日之下从港口出发？
How can boats be stolen
from a port in broad daylight?

1376
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:02,830
他们至少有保险吗？
Were they at least insured?

1377
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,250
您认为？
In your opinion?

1378
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:07,200
腾格拉尔股价暴跌
在股票市场上。
Danglars shares collapse
on the stock market.

1379
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,040
但感谢
陆军电报、
But thanks to the
army telegraph,

1380
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:15,410
腾格拉尔学得很快
真的什么都没发生。
Danglars will quickly learn
that nothing really happened.

1381
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:17,080
你必须偷他的船。
You had to steal his boats.

1382
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:19,660
一切都到了
等待者的时间到了。
Everything arrives on
time for those who wait.

1383
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:22,540
你得救了。他们的
船什么都没有。
You are saved. Their
boats have nothing.

1384
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:24,250
- 什么？
- 公正的人撒了谎。
- What?
- L'Imparcial lied.

1385
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:29,000
“腾格拉尔舰队仍然
"The Danglars fleet is still

1386
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,750
“漂浮在停泊处
马赛港”！
“afloat moored in
the port of Marseille”!

1387
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:36,450
谢谢。谢谢你们，我的朋友们。
Thanks. Thank you, my friends.

1388
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:39,750
腾格拉尔会记得
我的话和我的想法...
Danglars will remember
my words and think...

1389
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:42,700
这是由
L'Impartial 的新老板，
Which is a move by the
new boss of L'Impartial,

1390
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:44,410
我们亲爱的哈利法克斯勋爵。
our dear Lord Halifax.

1391
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,370
确切地。
Exactly.

1392
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:48,000
基督山是对的。
Monte Cristo was right.

1393
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:50,830
英国人用他的
报纸来猜测我的背影。
The Englishman uses his
newspaper to speculate about my back.

1394
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:52,830
你应该发表否认这一点的文章。
You should publish denying this.

1395
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:56,120
尤其不是。
Especially not.

1396
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,200
我不明白。
有必要...
I don't understand.
It is necessary...

1397
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,370
嘘！
Shh!

1398
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:01,500
你听到了吗？
Do you hear?

1399
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:03,330
听。
Listen.

1400
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,290
令人愉快的噪音。
The pleasant noise.

1401
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:09,830
那可口的小噪音。
That tasty little noise.

1402
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:13,660
金钱掉落的声音。
The sound of falling money.

1403
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,620
我也不明白。
I don't understand either.

1404
02:11:15,790 --> 02:11:19,870
想一想。他知道
尚无人知晓的事情。
Think about it. He knows
something that no one knows yet.

1405
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:24,540
想象一下：你玩扑克并且
了解对手的比赛。
Imagine: you play poker and
know your opponent's game.

1406
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:26,950
- 你在干什么？
- 我会重新开始。
- What are you doing?
- I'll restart.

1407
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,790
股票现价为
他们的最低水平。
Stocks are at
their lowest level.

1408
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:34,450
如果你过两天再买的话
将创造巨大的附加值。
If you buy them again in two days, I
will have made enormous added value.

1409
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:35,950
我最好的机会。
My best chance.

1410
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:37,250
回购你的股票？
Buy back your shares?

1411
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:38,910
需要多少钱？
How much would be needed?

1412
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,410
- 5亿。
- 5亿？
- 500 million.
- 500 million?

1413
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:43,830
5亿。但它
今天必须完成。
500 million. But it
must be done today.

1414
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,160
收市前及
在这个哈利法克斯败类之前。
Before the market closes and
before this Halifax scum does.

1415
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:51,080
我们怎样才能找到
今晚就五亿？
How can we find
500 million by tonight?

1416
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:56,790
要去见主
哈利法克斯最大的敌人。
Going to see Lord
Halifax's greatest enemy.

1417
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:26,750
对不起，男爵，但是……
I'm sorry, Baron, but...

1418
02:12:27,450 --> 02:12:29,700
大海一直
给我带来了厄运。
the sea has always
brought me bad luck.

1419
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:31,500
我不会买你的股票。
I'm not buying your shares.

1420
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:33,750
- 数数。
- 然而，
- Count.
- However,

1421
02:12:33,910 --> 02:12:37,000
我从不拒绝帮助
朋友并惩罚敌人。
I never refuse to help a
friend and punish an enemy.

1422
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:40,660
然后我会把钱借给你
你可以用它做任何你想做的事。
Then I will lend you that money and
you can do with it whatever you want.

1423
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,500
而且我可以保证
20%的利率。
And I can guarantee
a 20% interest rate.

1424
02:12:47,950 --> 02:12:49,910
我借给你
钱无息。
I will lend you
money interest free.

1425
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,000
在西西里岛，人们说：
In Sicily they say:

1426
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:55,120
“你不会变得富有
是在朋友的背后。”
“You won’t get rich
off the back of a friend.”

1427
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:56,540
我坚持。
I insist.

1428
02:12:57,330 --> 02:13:01,250
我有抵押贷款
以我的所有资产发行。
I had a mortgage
issued on all my assets.

1429
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:04,870
因此，它不是
价值五亿，但是……
Therefore, it is not
worth 500 million, but...

1430
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,000
2亿，
就是这样，我保证。
200 million,
that's it, I promise.

1431
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:09,500
不，男爵，你的
一句话对我来说就足够了。
No, Baron, your
word is enough for me.

1432
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,040
在法国我们说：
In France we say:

1433
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:13,370
“好账
结交好朋友。”
“Good accounts
make good friends.”

1434
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,330
就这样吧。为了友谊，我
接受您的个人保证。
So be it. For friendship, I
accept your personal guarantees.

1435
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,120
一周后，我将
你报销了吗？
In a week, I will
have you reimbursed.

1436
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:29,160
让我们把这个人
哈利法克斯投降。
Let's make this man
from Halifax surrender.

1437
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:31,410
投诉已准备就绪。
A complaint is ready.

1438
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,540
我会注意我所带来的
我本人在审判中对他提出指控。
I will see to it that I bring
charges against him at trial myself.

1439
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:39,660
我迫不及待地想出庭
见证这次处决。
I can't wait to be in court
to witness this execution.

1440
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:04,330
哈利法克斯勋爵，
L'Impartial 的所有者，
Lord Halifax,
owner of L'Impartial,

1441
02:14:04,700 --> 02:14:06,580
今天被传唤出庭作证
called to testify today

1442
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:09,250
回应
诽谤指控，
to respond to
accusations of defamation,

1443
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:11,660
他不得不离开
国家着急。
he had to leave the
country in a hurry.

1444
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:15,910
但您承诺确保
您的代表
But you undertake to ensure
that your representative

1445
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:18,370
下午 2 点到这个法庭
be in this courtroom at 2 p.m.

1446
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:47,750
喜剧《法官先生》
已经持续足够长的时间了。
Mr. Judge, the comedy
has gone on long enough.

1447
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:49,250
我们不在林荫大道上。
We are not on the boulevards.

1448
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:55,700
我问代表
哈利法克斯先生自我介绍。
I ask the representative of
Mr Halifax introduce himself.

1449
02:15:03,790 --> 02:15:06,450
你在干什么？
事情还没有结束。
What are you doing?
It's not over yet.

1450
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:25,580
我是哈利法克斯勋爵的
代表。
I am Lord Halifax's
representative.

1451
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:31,200
我在你面前
I'm in front of you

1452
02:15:31,370 --> 02:15:35,200
因为 L'Impartial 受到指控
发布假新闻。
because L'Impartial is accused
of having published fake news.

1453
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:37,450
但我在这里说
But I say here

1454
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:40,200
腾格拉尔船
实际上已经消失了。
that the Danglars boats
have effectively disappeared.

1455
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:42,700
无论如何，我的舰队
就在马赛！
Anyway, my fleet
is in Marseille!

1456
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:44,000
这是一个笑话！
It's a joke!

1457
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,500
- 你有什么证据？
- 这对你来说就足够了
- What proof do you have?
- It will be enough for you

1458
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:51,500
联系
马赛队长。
to contact the
Marseille captaincy.

1459
02:15:51,950 --> 02:15:55,250
那么你是否坚持
在你的陈述中？
So do you persist
in your statements?

1460
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:59,700
我坚持并签字，法官先生。
I persist and sign, Mr Judge.

1461
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,580
但我想做
以我的真实姓名。
But I want to do it
under my real name.

1462
02:16:02,950 --> 02:16:04,450
你是骗子吗？
Are you an impostor?

1463
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:11,000
人们都知道我是
安德里亚·卡瓦尔坎蒂
People know me as
Andrea Cavalcanti.

1464
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:14,700
经过多年的
街头，我被一个大
After years on the
streets, I was taken by a big

1465
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:17,750
和富裕的家庭
意大利贵族。
and rich family of
the Italian aristocracy.

1466
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:19,660
我像小偷一样长大
I grew up like a thief

1467
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:21,660
我最终
成为王子。
and I ended up
becoming a prince.

1468
02:16:21,830 --> 02:16:26,200
这不是一个更诚实的职业，
但更令人愉快。
It is not a more honest profession,
but much more enjoyable.

1469
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:33,000
正是在这里，在巴黎，我
终于找到了我的亲生父亲。
It's here, in Paris, that I
finally found my real father.

1470
02:16:39,790 --> 02:16:42,410
我出生于 1815 年 11 月 3 日。
I was born on November 3, 1815.

1471
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:46,620
在奥特伊。
In Auteuil.

1472
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,660
法官，就这样吧……
Judge, that's it...

1473
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,870
被告人能否出庭
证明他的主张？
Could the defendant present
proof of what he claims?

1474
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,660
我马上就到，
先生。律师。
I'll be right there,
sir. Attorney.

1475
02:17:02,830 --> 02:17:05,080
你的耐心将会得到回报。
Your patience will be rewarded.

1476
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:12,790
我是法国人的私生子
贵族和他的情妇！
I'm the bastard son of a French
aristocrat and his mistress!

1477
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:20,910
我妈妈不知道
我还活着，因为……我的父亲
My mother doesn't know
I'm alive because... my father

1478
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,580
我告诉他我
出生时就去世了。
I told him that I
had died at birth.

1479
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:27,790
他把我包裹在一个
布把我活埋了。
He wrapped me in a
cloth and buried me alive.

1480
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,450
先生，它讲的是一个
企图杀婴。
It speaks, sir, of an
attempt at infanticide.

1481
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:36,700
这就是应该发生的事情
That's what should have happened

1482
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:40,500
如果我阿姨没有选择
我从地上起来。
if my aunt hadn't picked
me up off the ground.

1483
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:42,290
谁在指责？
Who is accusing?

1484
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:44,950
一个值得尊敬的人...
A respectable man...

1485
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:46,910
你们都知道。
that you all know.

1486
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,870
他的手臂在这块亚麻布里。
His arm is in this linen.

1487
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:01,000
我的父亲...
My father...

1488
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:04,080
正是
我面前有一个人。
is none other than the
man I have before me.

1489
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:10,000
维尔福检察官。
The Prosecutor of Villefort.

1490
02:18:16,910 --> 02:18:19,540
- 或者我会撤离房间。
- 诽谤！
- Or I'll evacuate the room.
- Slander!

1491
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,330
我要起诉你！
I will sue you!

1492
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:23,080
卡瓦尔坎蒂先生，
Mr Cavalcanti,

1493
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,870
你明白吗
你的指控的严重性？
Do you understand the
seriousness of your accusations?

1494
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,200
我不会满足于一块布，
即使沾满了血。
I will not be satisfied with a cloth,
even if it is stained with blood.

1495
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:34,290
检察官将提供
你有我所说的证据。
The prosecutor will provide
you with proof of what I say.

1496
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:38,290
- 但他神志不清！
- 父亲。
- But he's delirious!
- Father.

1497
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:43,120
别让我妈妈出庭作证
Don't make my mother testify.

1498
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,290
我认为她有
受够了。
She, I think, has
suffered enough.

1499
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:58,160
审判暂停
The trial is suspended

1500
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:01,200
调查的时间。
我们撤离房间吧！
the time of an investigation.
Let's evacuate the room!

1501
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:04,250
还有一个。
And one.

1502
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:09,120
-来吧，维多利亚，来吧！
-饶恕。
-Come on, Victoria, come on!
-Forgiveness.

1503
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:11,040
让我们过去。
Let us through.

1504
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:25,250
你为什么不
告诉我真相吗？
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

1505
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:29,580
你父亲想要我
作为他的女婿，但是……
Your father wanted me
as his son-in-law, but...

1506
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:33,250
我不可能是你的
妈妈也是我的。
I couldn't be, your
mother is mine too.

1507
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:37,950
不要忘记你的生命线。
Don't forget your lifelines.

1508
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:40,040
姐姐要幸福啊
Be happy, sister.

1509
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
数数！
Count!

1510
02:19:58,290 --> 02:19:59,290
数数！
Count!

1511
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:04,080
这个故事毫无意义。
我们在精神错乱中游泳。
This story makes no sense.
We are swimming in delirium.

1512
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:07,750
我的船，昨天，
仍在马赛。我...
My boats, yesterday,
were still in Marseilles. I...

1513
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:12,120
我需要一个...
偿还期限。
I'm going to need a...
a deadline to repay it.

1514
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:14,200
如果...
If...

1515
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,450
什么都没有了，男爵。
There's nothing left, Baron.

1516
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:20,200
一切
是你的就是我的。
Everything that
was yours is mine.

1517
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:24,540
他唯一拥有的东西
剩下的是这些衣服。
The only thing he has
left are these clothes.

1518
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:29,080
离开巴黎也许
不离开你的妻子
Leave Paris and maybe
not leave your wife

1519
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:31,250
他的女儿也饿死了。
and his daughter dies of hunger.

1520
02:20:31,410 --> 02:20:33,040
但无论如何，告诉我，我...
But anyway, tell me, I...

1521
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,620
你认为我很残忍吗，男爵？
Do you think I'm brutal, Baron?

1522
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,540
不仅我知道，
Not only do I know that,

1523
02:20:41,830 --> 02:20:43,160
但我吹嘘它。
but I brag about it.

1524
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:54,870
呼吸不稳定
Unstable breathing

1525
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,540
你应该带你的妻子回家。
You should take your wife home.

1526
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:01,450
她的脸色非常苍白。
She is very pale.

1527
02:21:10,450 --> 02:21:11,500
还有两个。
And two.

1528
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:55,950
父亲！
Father!

1529
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:10,540
作者：安吉拉.
By Angèle.

1530
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:36,250
走开!
Get out of the way!

1531
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:37,620
不！
No!

1532
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:56,660
为了什么？
For what?

1533
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:59,540
为了什么？
For what?

1534
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:11,000
别哭。
Don't cry.

1535
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,330
我们就知道事情会这样结束。
We knew it would end like this.

1536
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:34,290
我们知道这一点。
We knew that.

1537
02:24:34,450 --> 02:24:35,410
海蒂！
Haydee!

1538
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,540
他不服从。
He disobeyed.

1539
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:45,250
你违抗了吗？
Did you disobey?

1540
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,830
你违背了什么？
What did you disobey?

1541
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:56,660
这只会教会他仇恨。
It only taught him hate.

1542
02:24:57,370 --> 02:24:59,750
他把那
他手中的匕首。
He placed that
dagger in his hand.

1543
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:05,500
这是你的痛苦在说话。
It is your pain that speaks.

1544
02:25:08,330 --> 02:25:09,790
我爱他就像爱儿子一样。
I loved him like a son.

1545
02:25:09,950 --> 02:25:11,160
嘲笑声
mocking laughter

1546
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:14,290
黑暗音乐
Dark music

1547
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:18,370
你也爱我吗？
Do you love me too?

1548
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,950
我也是，你准备好了吗
牺牲我来报仇？
Me too, are you ready to
sacrifice me for your revenge?

1549
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,790
这不是报复。
It's not revenge.

1550
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,750
这是正义。
It's justice.

1551
02:25:37,790 --> 02:25:40,790
别忘了你的泪水
海黛，你母亲的哭泣
Don't forget your tears,
Haydée, Your mother's cry

1552
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:42,790
和你父亲的血。
and your father's blood.

1553
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:44,750
以及名字
背叛他们的人。
And the name of the
person who betrayed them.

1554
02:25:45,580 --> 02:25:47,120
别忘了他的名字！
Don't forget his name!

1555
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,620
如果你爱我
If you love me

1556
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:22,620
既然我爱你，就不要
尝试再次见到我。
As I love you, don't
try to see me again.

1557
02:26:22,790 --> 02:26:25,250
他太高贵了
心里不明白。
He's too noble of
heart not to understand.

1558
02:26:25,410 --> 02:26:28,950
我保持我的力量
与自己战斗并喝下我的眼泪。
I maintain my strength to
fight myself and drink my tears.

1559
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:32,580
远离快乐
我，你值得拥有。
Be happy away from
me, you deserve it.

1560
02:26:40,910 --> 02:26:41,950
阿尔伯特？
Albert?

1561
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:20,580
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

1562
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:22,950
你疯了。
You are crazy.

1563
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,500
你不能留下来。
You can't stay.

1564
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:26,950
海黛，我只是
认识你有一段时间了...
Haydée, I've only
known you for a while...

1565
02:27:27,410 --> 02:27:28,500
留下它。
Leave it.

1566
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:31,250
像一个人一样逃离我
逃离瘟疫。
Flee from me like one
fleeing from the plague.

1567
02:27:32,330 --> 02:27:34,830
- 我会让你不高兴。
- 但跟我一起逃吧。
- I'm going to make you unhappy.
- But run away with me.

1568
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:37,250
我向你发誓，海黛，
I swear to you, Haydée,

1569
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:41,250
这不是绝望，而是
我向你承诺的幸福。
Instead of despair, This is
the happiness I promise you.

1570
02:27:42,330 --> 02:27:45,910
你不认识我。
伯爵不知道。
You don't know me.
The Count doesn't know.

1571
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,000
海蒂...
Haydee...

1572
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:48,950
如果你爱我
就像我爱你一样...
If you love me
like I love you...

1573
02:27:52,290 --> 02:27:53,750
告诉我再见。
Tell me goodbye.

1574
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,330
我求求你。
I beg you.

1575
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,500
说！
Say!

1576
02:28:06,290 --> 02:28:07,870
所以我会告诉你
So I'll tell you

1577
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:12,120
向阅读的上帝证明
我的内心深处...
attesting to God, who reads
the depths of my heart...

1578
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:18,830
祝你快乐
没有我记忆的生活。
I wish you a happy
life without my memory.

1579
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:23,160
再见，我的爱人。
Goodbye, my love.

1580
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:25,950
这个样子。
This look.

1581
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,870
没有你，我的生命就失去了。
Without you my life is lost.

1582
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:33,790
我的不幸，对吧。
My misfortune, right.

1583
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:36,290
你会怎样做？
What are you going to do?

1584
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:40,580
但请放心，我
我会遵守诺言。
But rest assured, I
will keep my promise.

1585
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:43,290
但拜托，你会活下去吗？
But please, will you live?

1586
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:45,330
什么对你来说很重要？
What is important to you?

1587
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:49,620
在你眼里，我已经死了。
In your eyes, I am already dead.

1588
02:28:58,330 --> 02:28:59,580
让我们逃跑。
Let's run away.

1589
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:13,660
海迪。
Haydee.

1590
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:16,660
如果你想加入
马尔塞夫家族，
If you want to join
the Morcerf family,

1591
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,790
阿尔伯特值得知道
Albert deserves to know

1592
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,080
你的故事。
your story.

1593
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,200
如果你保持沉默，我就会
被迫代替你说话。
If you remain silent, I will be
forced to speak in your place.

1594
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:28,750
我真的需要谈谈
I really need to talk

1595
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:30,160
以你的名义？
in your name?

1596
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:32,540
请告诉我。
Tell me, please.

1597
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:34,160
海黛就是那个女孩……
Haydée is the girl...

1598
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:35,540
停止！
Stop!

1599
02:29:40,290 --> 02:29:41,620
我会说话。
I will speak.

1600
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,950
黑暗音乐
Dark music

1601
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:03,950
我的父亲是一位杰出的
这个人名叫阿里·特贝林 (Ali Tebelin)。
My father was an illustrious
man known as Ali Tebelin.

1602
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:09,080
贾尼娜帕夏。
Pasha of Janina.

1603
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:17,950
我当时10岁
I was 10 years old

1604
02:30:18,410 --> 02:30:21,000
当他之前被杀的时候
我的眼睛和我母亲的眼睛。
when he was killed before
my eyes and my mother's.

1605
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,120
接收一名法国士兵
Received a French soldier

1606
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,370
谁是我们的盟友。
who was our ally.

1607
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:30,580
被十几颗子弹射穿，
Pierced by a dozen bullets,

1608
02:30:32,290 --> 02:30:33,120
我的父亲
my father

1609
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:35,790
找到了站立的力量
found the strength to stand

1610
02:30:37,540 --> 02:30:39,910
并射杀了卖掉它的人
and shot the man who sold it

1611
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:44,200
挖出眼睛。
gouging out the eye.

1612
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,830
我再也没有见过我的母亲。
I never saw my mother again.

1613
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:53,500
这位官员卖了
我沦为奴隶
This officer sold
me into slavery

1614
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:55,790
巴尔干地区的一个瓦拉几部落。
to a Vlach tribe in the Balkans.

1615
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,660
- 他的名字是...
- 够了。
- His name was...
- That's enough.

1616
02:30:58,830 --> 02:30:59,910
阿尔伯特.
Albert.

1617
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:08,120
- 你操纵了我。
- 我警告过你。
- You manipulated me.
- I warned you.

1618
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:11,540
- 你利用了我。
- 你可能会后悔你的话。
- You used me.
- You may regret your words.

1619
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:14,750
- 你觉得你在吓唬我吗？
- 别激怒我。
- Do you think you're scaring me?
- Don't provoke me.

1620
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,370
阿尔伯特，请。
Albert, please.

1621
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,540
数数！
Count!

1622
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:21,790
它夺走了我的一切。
除了我的名字，你弄脏了。
It took everything away from me.
Except my name, which you dirty.

1623
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:23,500
不！
No!

1624
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:26,200
哦，伯爵，我求求你了。
Oh, Count, I beg you.

1625
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,080
我认为你的手套被丢弃了。
I consider your glove discarded.

1626
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:32,080
我会把它卷起来还给你
明天打个球。
I'll return it to you rolled
up in a ball tomorrow.

1627
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:42,080
你不后悔吗？
Aren't you sorry?

1628
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:44,620
他们有没有
爱德蒙唐太斯？
Did they have any
for Edmond Dantès?

1629
02:31:45,950 --> 02:31:47,040
看着我。
Look at me.

1630
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:51,450
我只不过是
聋哑人武装手臂致死。
I am nothing more than the
armed arm of deaf and blind fatality.

1631
02:31:56,410 --> 02:31:59,540
费尔南·德·马尔塞夫将体验
我父亲的经历。
Fernand de Morcerf will experience
what my father experienced.

1632
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:04,290
如果你杀了艾伯特
If you kill Albert,

1633
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:09,750
你将不再能够
说：“神帮助我，与我同在。”
you will no longer be able to
say: “God is for me, with me.”

1634
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:13,580
他将成为一名杀手。
He will be a killer.

1635
02:32:17,410 --> 02:32:21,250
圣经说，孩子们
将为父母的罪行付出代价。
The Bible says that children
will pay for their parents' crimes.

1636
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,330
雅各布，跟着她。
Jacopo, follow her.

1637
02:33:06,370 --> 02:33:07,620
他带着枪。
He carries his gun.

1638
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:12,410
离开我们吧，雅各布。
Leave us, Jacopo.

1639
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:15,700
女士。
Madam.

1640
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:17,870
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

1641
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:20,660
埃德蒙，你
不会杀死我的儿子。
Edmond, you
will not kill my son.

1642
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,700
你说的是什么名字？
What name did you say?

1643
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:25,330
你的。
Yours.

1644
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:28,250
不是马尔塞夫夫人
Not Madame de Morcerf

1645
02:33:28,410 --> 02:33:30,160
谁在前面
你是梅赛德斯。
who is in front of
you is Mercédès.

1646
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:32,500
我谁也不认识
用那个名字。
I don't know anyone
with that name.

1647
02:33:35,330 --> 02:33:37,120
我认出你是
我一看到你。
I recognized you as
soon as I saw you.

1648
02:33:38,410 --> 02:33:40,870
即使没有见到你，我
会认出你的声音。
And even without seeing you, I
would have recognized your voice.

1649
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:45,040
我的理智很挣扎，但我的心
知道。从那时起，我就一直关注他，
My reason was struggling, but my heart
knew. Since then, I have been following him,

1650
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,120
看着他，寻找
他想要马尔塞夫做什么。
watching him, looking for
what he wants with Morcerf.

1651
02:33:47,290 --> 02:33:49,620
费尔南德，我是说，女士。
Fernand, I mean, ma'am.

1652
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:52,750
既然我们还记得
我们的名字。
Since we can remember
our first names.

1653
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:57,290
我应该受到责备。
I'm to blame.

1654
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:02,080
是我缺乏力量
面对你的缺席。
It was I who lacked strength
in the face of your absence.

1655
02:34:03,160 --> 02:34:05,790
我就是那个
当你死的时候缺乏信心。
I was the one who
lacked faith when you died.

1656
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:09,620
- 我的！
- 为了什么？ 为什么只有我一个人？
- My!
- For what? Why was I alone?

1657
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:13,250
他为什么缺席？
我为什么被捕？
Why was he absent?
Why was I arrested?

1658
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:16,160
为什么我被推定死亡？
Why was I presumed dead?

1659
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:17,700
我不知道。
I don't know.

1660
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:24,620
我想象他不再
给你写情书，
I imagine he no longer
writes you love letters,

1661
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:27,500
但你会很容易
识别你的笔迹。
but you will easily
recognize your handwriting.

1662
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:31,660
然后。
Then.

1663
02:34:32,790 --> 02:34:34,410
瞧，梅赛德斯。
Look, Mercédès.

1664
02:34:36,660 --> 02:34:38,540
这是你老公写的
This is what your husband wrote

1665
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:40,660
20年前到维尔福。
to Villefort 20 years ago.

1666
02:34:44,370 --> 02:34:48,370
我一定要报仇
梅赛德斯。必须如此。
I must take revenge,
Mercédès. It has to be.

1667
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:52,660
所以，复仇吧，爱德蒙。
So take revenge, Edmond.

1668
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,330
但关于罪魁祸首。
But about the culprits.

1669
02:34:58,950 --> 02:35:03,370
向背叛的费尔南多报仇
你，为我报仇，但饶过艾伯特吧。
Take revenge on Fernand who betrayed
you, take revenge on me, but spare Albert.

1670
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:10,000
如果你知道所有的祈祷...
If you knew all the prayers...

1671
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:16,040
如果你知道一切
我流下的泪水...
If you knew all
the tears I shed...

1672
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:19,160
你是否失去了你的
父亲孤独吗？
Did you lose your
father in solitude?

1673
02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:23,120
你看到你的人了吗
爱在你的情敌怀里？
Did you see the person you
loved in the arms of your rival?

1674
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:27,330
- 你看到这一切了吗？
- 不。
- Did you see all this?
- No.

1675
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,500
是的。
Yes.

1676
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:33,750
但我看到了我的那个人
从未停止过爱
But I see the man I
never stopped loving

1677
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:36,370
准备成为杀害我儿子的凶手
ready to become my son's killer.

1678
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,500
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1679
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:57,950
你想让你的孩子活下去吗？
Do you want your child to live?

1680
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,330
他会活下去。
He will live.

1681
02:36:04,330 --> 02:36:05,370
谢谢。
Thanks.

1682
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,410
谢谢你，埃德蒙。
Thank you, Edmond.

1683
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:15,660
我会再次找到你。
I will find you again.

1684
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:21,790
我怎么一直梦想着
你，我一直多么爱你。
How I always dreamed of
you, how I always loved you.

1685
02:36:39,410 --> 02:36:41,200
我们必须说再见了。
We must say goodbye.

1686
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
再见？
Goodbye?

1687
02:36:46,830 --> 02:36:48,870
如果我放弃伸张正义
交到我自己手里，
If I give up taking justice
into my own hands,

1688
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:52,160
我放弃了让我活下去的东西。
I give up what keeps me alive.

1689
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:57,750
决斗将进行
明天的地方。
The duel will take
place tomorrow.

1690
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,870
再见，梅塞德斯。
Goodbye, Mercédès.

1691
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,250
阿尔贝·德·马尔塞夫爵士，
Sir Albert de Morcerf,

1692
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:18,830
公开挑衅
基督山伯爵。
publicly provoked the
Count of Monte Cristo.

1693
02:37:19,450 --> 02:37:22,370
决斗将于
20步，听我指挥。
The duel will take place at
20 paces, at my command.

1694
02:37:23,370 --> 02:37:24,870
优先考虑那些被冒犯的人。
Priority to those offended.

1695
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,580
就位。
In position.

1696
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:35,410
来吧，先生们。
Come on, gentlemen.

1697
02:37:58,370 --> 02:37:59,370
火！
Fire!

1698
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:27,370
火！
Fire!

1699
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:15,160
我想我看到了一丝
你眼中的失望。
I think I see a gleam of
disappointment in your eyes.

1700
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:20,750
我永远不会原谅
你夺走了他的生命
I will never forgive
you for taking his life

1701
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:23,450
并掏出我的心。
and for ripping out my heart.

1702
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:27,540
所以我爱他。
So I loved him.

1703
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:30,120
如果我爱他怎么办？
What if I loved him?

1704
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:35,790
一切都让我讨厌他
但我们知道我们为什么相爱吗？
Everything made me hate him,
but do we know why we fell in love?

1705
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:39,830
无论我们如何努力
互相讲道理，已经太晚了。
No matter how much we try to
reason with each other, it's too late.

1706
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:41,830
我们失去了平衡。
We lost our balance.

1707
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:47,620
没有机会了
There is no more chance

1708
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:51,750
但与其听到这个
声音，我听到的是你的声音。
But instead of hearing this
voice, It's yours that I heard.

1709
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:56,500
我会造成
他的不幸和我的不幸！
I would have caused
his misfortune and mine!

1710
02:39:58,950 --> 02:40:02,660
我要做什么
这份爱我没有给过你吗？
What am I going to do with
this love I didn't give you?

1711
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:07,040
那些话里
我没告诉你吗？
Of those words
I didn't tell you?

1712
02:40:09,330 --> 02:40:11,200
你告诉他了。
You told him.

1713
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,910
他听了他们的意见。
And he listened to them.

1714
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,580
阿尔伯特...
Albert...

1715
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:40,450
数数！
Count!

1716
02:40:47,870 --> 02:40:49,370
现在就逃吧。
Run away now.

1717
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:52,790
逃跑，不让
任何人都会偷走你的幸福。
Run away and don't let
anyone steal your happiness.

1718
02:41:32,790 --> 02:41:33,450
埃德蒙！
Edmond!

1719
02:41:40,040 --> 02:41:41,040
埃德蒙！
Edmond!

1720
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:48,540
艾德蒙，展现你自己吧！
Edmond, show yourself!

1721
02:41:54,330 --> 02:41:55,700
我在等你。

1722

终于露出了他的真面目。

1723
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,290
我试图找到你的。

1724
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:04,870
知道他是谁。
Know who he was.

1725
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:08,160
然后我就跟着
按照他的脚步。
Then I followed
in his footsteps.

1726
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,950
我到处都去过
你去过。
I've been everywhere
you've been.

1727
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:14,580
我遇见了他们所有人：
I met them all:

1728
02:42:15,410 --> 02:42:18,790
你的朋友，你的兄弟
武器，你的敌人，每个人......
your friends, your brothers in
arms, your enemies, everyone...

1729
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:21,580
谁没被骗过？
Who hasn't cheated?

1730
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:24,910
你对谁保持忠诚？
To whom did you remain loyal?

1731
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:27,830
无处不在的你
露出了你的真面目。
Everywhere, you
showed your true face.

1732
02:42:28,870 --> 02:42:29,620
我输了
I lost

1733
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:31,200
对人的信心，
faith in man,

1734
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:33,330
你背叛我的那一天。
the day you betrayed me.

1735
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:37,000
我应该自杀的。
I should have killed myself.

1736
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:38,620
永远不会太晚。
It's never too late.

1737
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:39,790
起床。
Get up.

1738
02:47:00,580 --> 02:47:01,830
看着我。
Look at me.

1739
02:47:02,580 --> 02:47:03,700
看着我！
Look at me!

1740
02:47:03,870 --> 02:47:06,950
他喘着粗气。
He pants.

1741
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:07,950
- 杀了我。
- Kill me.

1742
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:13,040
我们总是发现
死者的伟大。
We always find
greatness in the dead.

1743
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:15,870
我们最终原谅了他们。
We ended up forgiving them.

1744
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:23,620
我不想被原谅。
I don't want to be forgiven.

1745
02:48:36,370 --> 02:48:39,660
梅赛德斯我来了
向你说再见
Mercédès, I came
to say goodbye to you

1746
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:41,870
生命分离的地方
我们彼此，
where life separated
us from each other,

1747
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:43,660
21年前的今天。
21 years ago today.

1748
02:48:44,330 --> 02:48:48,000
很多东西都坏了
从那时起，在我和我周围，
So many things have broken
in me and around me since then,

1749
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:50,200
我认识的那个人
不再存在。
that the man I knew
no longer exists.

1750
02:48:50,790 --> 02:48:53,080
我答应过
爱你直到我死
I promised to
love you until I die

1751
02:48:53,250 --> 02:48:54,910
而又过了很长一段时间，
and still a long time later,

1752
02:48:55,410 --> 02:48:57,120
我会永远爱你，
and I will always love you,

1753
02:48:57,290 --> 02:49:00,200
但它已经不再是我的了
给你带来幸福的力量。
but it is no longer in my
power to bring you happiness.

1754
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:03,500
我只能给你安慰。
I can only offer you comfort.

1755
02:49:04,450 --> 02:49:06,290
你的孩子会很高兴。
Your child will be happy.

1756
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:10,410
艾伯特和海黛将活着
我们无法经历的故事。
Albert and Haydée will live
the story we couldn't experience.

1757
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:12,250
为我们的孩子带来幸福
Happiness for our children

1758
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:15,910
这将使我们生存下去并且
尝到爱情的甜蜜。
that will survive us and
taste the sweetness of love.

1759
02:49:17,410 --> 02:49:20,200
当我写信给你时，我还活着
我和你在一起的最后时刻。
As I write to you, I am living
my last moments with you.

1760
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:23,830
之后的一切
将只是回忆。
Everything afterward
will be just memories.

1761
02:49:24,450 --> 02:49:26,910
我会带他们
和我一起去海边，
I will take them
with me to the sea,

1762
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:29,750
地球上唯一的地方
一切都在地平线上
the only place on earth
where everything is horizon

1763
02:49:30,290 --> 02:49:33,080
以及哪里有
没有人类留下的痕迹。
and where there are
no traces left by men.

1764
02:49:34,330 --> 02:49:36,620
生活并快乐。
Live and be happy.

1765
02:49:37,330 --> 02:49:38,410
永远不要忘记，
Never forget,

1766
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:42,000
直到天意降临的那一天
或许让我们再次相聚，
until the day when providence
perhaps brings us together again,

1767
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:45,080
人类所有的智慧
就在这两个词里：
that all human wisdom
is in these two words:

1768
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:46,910
等待
wait for

1769
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:48,410
和希望。
and hope.

1770
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:52,120
埃德蒙·唐泰斯,
Edmond Dantes,

1771
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:54,500
基督山伯爵。
the Count of Monte Cristo.
